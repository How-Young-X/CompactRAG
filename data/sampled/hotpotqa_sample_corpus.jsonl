In 1896, George Nicholson raised it to species rank as \"Zelkova verschaffeltii\", while its much closer similarity to \"Zelkova carpinifolia\" led Augustine Henry to suggest it might be a hybrid between \"Zelkova carpinifolia\" and \"Zelkova abelicea\".  More recent authors most widely regarded it as a cultivar, either not ascribed to any \"Zelkova\" species in particular, or placed under \"Z. carpinifolia\" with no suggestion of hybrid origin.  Analysis of flavonoids has subsequently proved that it is a hybrid between \"Zelkova carpinifolia\" and \"Zelkova serrata\"."}

{"title": "Ford flathead V8 engine", "passage": "The Ford flathead V8 (often called simply the Ford flathead, flathead Ford, or flatty when the context is implicit, such as in hot-rodding) is a V8 engine of the valve-in-block type designed by the Ford Motor Company and built by Ford and various licensees.  During the engine's first decade of production, when overhead-valve engines were rare, it was usually known simply as the Ford V‑8, and the first car model in which it was installed, the Model 18, was (and still is) often called simply the \"Ford V‑8\", after its new engine.  Although the V8 configuration was not new when the Ford V8 was introduced in 1932, the latter was a market first in the respect that it made an 8-cylinder affordable and a V engine affordable to the emerging mass market consumer for the first time.  It was the first independently designed and built V8 engine produced by Ford for mass production, and it ranks as one of the company's most important developments.  A fascination with ever-more-powerful engines was perhaps the most salient aspect of the American car and truck market for a half century, from 1923 until 1973.  The Ford flathead V8 was perfectly in tune with the cultural moment of its introduction, leading the way into a future of which the Ford company was a principal architect.  Thus it became a phenomenal success.  The engine design, with various changes but no major ones, was installed in Ford passenger cars and trucks until 1953, making the engine's 21-year production run for the U.S. consumer market longer than the 19-year run of the Ford Model T engine for that market.  The engine was on Ward's list of the 10 best engines of the 20th century.  It was a staple of hot rodders in the 1950s, and it remains famous in the classic car hobbies even today, despite the huge variety of other popular V8s that followed."}

{"title": "Curve fitting", "passage": "Curve fitting is the process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function, that has the best fit to a series of data points, possibly subject to constraints.  Curve fitting can involve either interpolation, where an exact fit to the data is required, or smoothing, in which a \"smooth\" function is constructed that approximately fits the data.  A related topic is regression analysis, which focuses more on questions of statistical inference such as how much uncertainty is present in a curve that is fit to data observed with random errors.  Fitted curves can be used as an aid for data visualization, to infer values of a function where no data are available, and to summarize the relationships among two or more variables.  Extrapolation refers to the use of a fitted curve beyond the range of the observed data, and is subject to a degree of uncertainty since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data."}

A few species extend to temperate regions, with ca. 10 species in the United States, mostly in the southern states from California to Florida, and only two species in Canada; China has 35 species, also mostly southern.  Only one species (\"E. aquaticum\") occurs in Europe, where it is confined to the Atlantic Ocean coasts of Scotland and Ireland; this species also occurs in eastern North America and is thought to be a relatively recent natural colonist in Europe.  In the Americas, \"Eriocaulon\" is the only genus in its family that occurs north of Florida.  They tend to be associated with wet soils, many growing in shallow water, in wetlands, or in wet savannas like flatwoods.  In wet soils, their abundance appears to be related to water levels, fire frequency, and competition from other plants such as grasses.  Experiments have shown that they are weak competitors compared to many other wetland plant species.  Some species can persist as buried seeds during unfavorable conditions.  The scientific name is derived from Ancient Greek εριον, \"erion\", meaning 'wool', and καυλός, \"caulos\", meaning 'stalk'."}

Grothendieck's scheme theory allows the structure sheaf to carry nilpotent elements. Derived algebraic geometry can be thought of as an extension of this, and provides natural settings for intersection theory (or motivic homotopy theory) of singular algebraic varieties and cotangent complexes in deformation theory (cf. F. Francis)."}

{"title": "UK Classical Charts", "passage": "The UK Classical Charts are three record charts based on classical music in the United Kingdom: the Classical Artist Albums Chart, the Classical Compilation Albums Chart and the Specialist Classical Albums Chart.  The charts are commercial monitoring and marketing devices used by the UK music industry to measure its effectiveness in promoting and selling albums, nominally in the field of classical music.  All three charts are compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC).  The measurements are made by collating the returns of sales from a number of well-known music stores (high street and online stores) on a regular basis, and this enables a ranking to be established.  Most classical artist album sales in the UK are from crossover artists.  For an album to be classified as classical in the charts, it has to have 60% of the playing time dedicated to \"classical or traditional music\".  Only albums that entirely classical or traditional music qualify for inclusion in the Specialist Classical Albums Chart."}
{"title": "Musical composition", "passage": "Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music.  People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music."}
{"title": "List of Indian classical music festivals", "passage": "The following is an incomplete list of Indian classical music festivals, which encapsulates music festivals focused on Indian classical music.  The origins of Indian classical music can be found in the Vedas, which are the oldest scriptures in the Hindu tradition dating back to 1500 BC.  Indian classical music has also been significantly influenced by, or syncretised with, Indian folk music.  There are two divisions in Indian classical music.  Hindustani music is mainly found in North India.  Carnatic music, from South India, tends to be more rhythdogs have bonessive and structured than Hindustani music.  While some festivals such as the Carnatic event Tyagaraja Aradhana (founded in the 1840s) continue to focus on traditional Carnatic classical music, an emergent trend of the past few decades has been that of fusion music, where genres such as khyal and western music are intermixed to appeal"}
{"title": "Canadian classical music", "passage": "In Canada, classical music includes a range of musical styles rooted in the traditions of Western or European classical music that European settlers brought to the country from the 17th century and onwards.  As well, it includes musical styles brought by other ethnic communities from the 19th century and onwards, such as Indian classical music (Hindustani and Carnatic music) and Chinese classical music.  Since Canada's emergence as a nation in 1867, the country has produced its own composers, musicians and ensembles.  As well, it has developed a music infrastructure that includes training institutions, conservatories, performance halls, and a public radio broadcaster, CBC, which programs a moderate amount of Classical music.  There is a high level of public interest in classical music and education."}
{"title": "List of classical music festivals", "passage": "The following is an incomplete list of classical music festivals, which encapsulates music festivals focused on classical music.  Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music (both liturgical and secular), and has long been played at festival-like settings.  It encompasses a broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day.  The major time divisions of classical music are as follows: the early music period, which includes the Medieval (500–1400) and the Renaissance (1400–1600) era, played at early music festivals; the common practice period, which includes the Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1750–1830), and Romantic eras (1804–1910), which included opera festivals and choral festivals; and the 20th century (1901–2000) which includes the modern (1890–1930) that overlaps from the late 19th-century, the high modern (mid 20th-century), and contemporary classical music festivals or postmodern (1975–2000) eras, the last of which overlaps into the 21st-century.  The term \"classical music\" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Beethoven as a golden age."}

{"title": "Black hole bomb", "passage": "A black hole bomb is the name given to a physical effect utilizing how a bosonic field impinging on a rotating black hole can be amplified through superradiant scattering.  An additional condition which must be met is that the field must have a rest mass different from zero.  The scattered wave will then be reflected back and forth between the mass term and the black hole becoming amplified on each reflection.  The growth of the field is asserted to be exponential and unstable.  The mechanism by which the black hole bomb functions is called superradiant instability."}
{"title": "V404 Cygni", "passage": "V404 Cygni is a microquasar and a binary system consisting of a black hole with a mass of about and an early K companion star of mass slightly smaller than the Sun in the constellation of Cygnus.

Due to their proximity and the intense gravity of the black hole, the companion star loses mass to an accretion disk around the black hole and ultimately to the black hole itself."}
{"title": "Ergosphere", "passage": "The ergosphere is a region located outside a rotating black hole's outer event horizon.  Its name was proposed by Remo Ruffini and John Archibald Wheeler during the Les Houches lectures in 1971 and is derived from the Greek word \"ergon\", which means \"work\".  It received this name because it is theoretically possible to extract energy and mass from this region.  The ergosphere touches the event horizon at the poles of a rotating black hole and extends to a greater radius at the equator.  With a low spin of the central mass the shape of the ergosphere can be approximated by an oblated spheroid, while with higher spins it resembles a pumpkin-shape.  The equatorial (maximum) radius of an ergosphere corresponds to the Schwarzschild radius of a non-rotating black hole; the polar (minimum) radius can be as little as half the Schwarzschild radius (the radius of a non-rotating black hole) in the case that the black hole is rotating maximally (at higher rotation rates the black hole could not have formed)."}
{"title": "Extreme mass ratio inspiral", "passage": "In astrophysics, an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) is the orbit of a relatively light object around a much heavier (by a factor 10,000 or more) object, that gradually decays due the emission of gravitational waves.  Such systems are likely to be found in the centers of galaxies, where stellar mass compact objects, such as stellar black holes and neutron stars, may be found orbiting a supermassive black hole.  In the case of a black hole in orbit around another black hole this is an extreme mass ratio binary black hole.  The term EMRI is sometimes used as a shorthand to denote the emitted gravitational waveform as well as the orbit itself."}

M33 X-7 is the largest known stellar black hole with an estimated mass of 15.65 times that of the Sun (M ).  The total mass of the system is estimated to be around 85.7 M , which would make it the most massive black hole binary system."}
{"title": "Membrane paradigm", "passage": "In black hole theory, the black hole membrane paradigm is a simplified model, useful for visualising and calculating the effects predicted by quantum mechanics for the exterior physics of black holes, without using quantum-mechanical principles or calculations.  It models a black hole as a thin, classically radiating surface (or membrane) at or vanishingly close to the black hole's event horizon.  This approach to the theory of black holes was created by Kip S. Thorne, R. H. Price and D. A. Macdonald."}
{"title": "De Sitter–Schwarzschild metric", "passage": "In general relativity, the de Sitter–Schwarzschild solution describes a black hole in a causal patch of de Sitter space.  Unlike a flat-space black hole, there is a largest possible de Sitter black hole, which is the Nariai spacetime.  The Nariai limit has no singularities, the cosmological and black hole horizons have the same area, and they can be mapped to each other by a discrete reflection symmetry in any causal patch."}
{"title": "Penrose process", "passage": "The Penrose process (also called Penrose mechanism) is a process theorised by Roger Penrose wherein energy can be extracted from a rotating black hole.  That extraction is made possible because the rotational energy of the black hole is located not inside the event horizon of the black hole, but on the outside of it in a region of the Kerr spacetime called the ergosphere, a region in which a particle is necessarily propelled in locomotive concurrence with the rotating spacetime.  All objects in the ergosphere become dragged by a rotating spacetime.  In the process, a lump of matter enters into the ergosphere of the black hole, and once it enters the ergosphere, it is forcibly split into two parts.  For example, the matter might be made of two parts that separate by firing an explosive or rocket which pushes its halves apart.  The momentum of the two pieces of matter when they separate can be arranged so that one piece escapes from the black hole (it \"escapes to infinity\"), whilst the other falls past the event horizon into the black hole.  With careful arrangement, the escaping piece of matter can be made to have greater mass-energy than the original piece of matter, and the infalling piece has negative mass-energy.  Although momentum is conserved the effect is that more energy can be extracted than was originally provided, the difference being provided by the black hole itself.  In summary, the process results in a slight decrease in the angular momentum of the black hole, which corresponds to a transference of energy to the matter.  The momentum lost is converted to energy extracted."}

The battle occurred on November 29, 1574 when Limahong's fleet landed in the town of Parañaque and from there, began to assault the fortifications of Intramuros.  Initially, the inhabitants where disorganized and Limahong's forces routed them.  Furthermore, the Chinese killed the Master-of-Camp of the Spanish, Martin De Goiti.  This caused them to delay their assault on Manila as Martin de Goiti's house was an obstacle in their march.  However, upon the arrival of a certain Filipino hero called, Galo, resistance started to organize.  Under Galo's command, they were able to resist China-born Limahong until Mexico-born Juan de Salcedo arrived from Ilocos with 300 Ilocano Warriors and Limahong was defeated and eventually forced to retreat.

Notably, the political wing of the group (the Building and Development Party) and the Wasat Party did not take part in protests held by pro-Morsi forces during the week of 18 October 2013.  The alliance offered a new reconciliation initiative that does not include the reinstatement of Morsi on 26 October 2013; al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Homeland Party are not calling for the reinstatement of Morsi, while the Virtue Party, Authenticity Party and the Muslim Brotherhood are still demanding that Morsi be reinstated as president.  The group has reached out to what it called \"fellow revolutionaries\" to cooperate with them against the protest law in Egypt in order to jointly organize protests; Kefaya objected to the call for cooperation.

The alliance has said it will boycott the 2014 constitutional referendum.  Various groups and parties within the alliance including al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the Building and Development Party, the Islamic Party, the Freedom and Justice Party and the Virtue Party have criticized the Nour Party for its support of the draft constitution.  The Islamic Party has not participated in meetings with the group because of what Mohamed Abu Samra (the secretary-general of the party) called the \"brotherhood's radical thought\".  The Salafist Front issued a statement on 30 April 2014 that called on the alliance to temporarily stop its actions in order to avoid more violence; the alliance did not suspend its activities in response.  Egyptian Prime minister Ibrahim Mahlab issued a decree on 16 October 2014 banning the alliance.  Another decree was issued on 30 October 2014 which dissolved the alliance.

This particular \"tariqa\" (order) became the dominant Muslim spiritual group in medieval India and many of the most beloved and venerated Indian Sunni saints were Chishti in their affiliation, including Nizamuddin Awliya (d. 1325) and Amir Khusrow (d. 1325).  As such, Muʿīn al-Dīn Chishtī's legacy rests primarily on his having been \"one of the most outstanding figures in the annals of Islamic mysticism.\"  Additionally, Muʿīn al-Dīn Chishtī is also notable for having been one of the first major Islamic mystics to formally allow his followers to incorporate the \"use of music\" in their devotions, liturgies, and hymns to God, which he did so in order to make the foreign Arab faith more relatable to the indigenous peoples who had recently entered the religion or whom he sought to convert."}

It partnered other plays before a run of six performances in tandem with \"The Fatal Discovery\" by John Home.  \"The Padlock\" was a success, largely due to Dibdin's portrayal of Mungo, a blackface caricature of a black servant from the West Indies.  The company took the production to the United States the next year, where a portrayal by Lewis Hallam, Jr. as Mungo met with even greater accolades.  The libretto was first published in London in 1768 (?)  and in Dublin in 1775.  The play remained in regular circulation in the U.S. as late as 1843.  It was revived by the Old Vic Company in London and on tour in the UK in 1979 in a new orchestration by Don Fraser and played in a double-bill with Garrick's \"Miss In Her Teens\".

{"title": "Billboard Year-End", "passage": "\"Billboard\" Year-End charts are a cumulative measure of a single or album's performance in the United States, based upon the \"Billboard\" magazine charts during any given chart year.  \"Billboard's\" \"chart year\" runs from the first Billboard \"week\" of December to the final week in November, but because the Billboard week is dated in advance of publication, the last calendar week for which sales are counted is usually the third week in November.  This altered calendar allows for \"Billboard\" to calculate year-end charts and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of December.  Prior to incorporating chart data from Nielsen SoundScan (from 1991), year-end charts were calculated by an inverse-point system based solely on a title's performance (for example a single appearing on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 would be given one point for a week spent at position 100, two points for a week spent at position ninety-nine, and so forth, up to 100 points for each week spent at number one).  Other factors including the total weeks a song spent on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into its year-end total.  The same method was used for albums based on the \"Billboard\" 200, and songs appearing on the other charts (e.g. Hot Country Singles)."}
{"title": "Psycho Circus World Tour", "passage": "Psycho Circus World Tour was a Kiss concert tour in 1998–2000.  It was the first concert tour in history to have 3-D visual effects.  The Smashing Pumpkins opened at the Dodger Stadium show only, in costume as The Beatles for the Halloween night performance.  The Dodger Stadium show was streamed live on the internet as well as a radio broadcast.  Two songs, \"Psycho Circus\" and \"Shout It Out Loud\", were screened live on Fox television as part of the \"Kiss Live: The Ultimate Halloween Party\" special.  The vast majority of songs in the setlist were played on the previous Alive/Worldwide concert dates, leading to some frustration from fans expecting the return of classic songs not played on the previous tour.  Peter Criss was quoted in Metal Edge magazine at the time as wanting to add \"Parasite\" to the setlist.  The tour was initially hyped as having circus-style acts as pre-show entertainment.  This ultimately happened only at the first concert at Dodger Stadium.  Peter Criss later said that it didn't work out because the circus performers wanted equal billing and that some had even wanted to use KISS' backstage dressing room.  \"2,000 Man\" was played to bring in the new Millennium at the 1999/2000 New Year's Eve show at Vancouver, advertised at the time as being recorded for Alive IV.  The Vancouver show was also notable as being the first time the original members had played non-original band era material live in concert – \"I Love It Loud\", \"Lick It Up\" and \"Heaven's on Fire\" were added to the setlist and subsequently played on the Farewell Tour.  \"Forever\" was listed on concert setlists at the Vancouver show but was not played.  It was thought at the time it may have been intended as a Paul Stanley solo version prior to \"Black Diamond\".  One notable show on the tour was the March 12 Bremen, Germany, show.  After the opening song, Paul Stanley announced that the local fire marshall had banned Kiss from using any pyrotechnics during the show.  They used a translator on stage to let the crowd understand exactly what Stanley was saying.  At the end of the performance, the band ignited all of the pyrotechnics at once; as a result, they were banned from performing in Bremen.  Ticket sales for this tour were notably slower than the previous Reunion Tour, with many of the smaller market shows underselling and a second North American leg for the summer of 1999 cancelled all together, the band ultimatly decided on embarking on a Farewell tour in the new millennium."}

Many years later the English group \"The Beat\" released \"Heart Of The Congos\" on their own \"Go-Feat\" label, as did the company \"Blood And Fire\", and \"Heart Of The Congos\" was a big success,and rightly so, however it has to be said that had the album been released when it was first recorded it would have been a massive success.  Instead it was released initially in very limited numbers on Lee Perry's \"Black Art\" label and Perry re-mixed the album adding various external sounds, such as \"cow Horns\" provided by the barritoned Burnett.  They recorded the album \"Heart of the Congos\", with Lee Perry at the controls, producing what is widely considered one of the great classics of reggae.  Later Myton pursued a solo career.

Snowkiting is becoming increasingly popular in places often associated with skiing and snowboarding, such as Russia, Canada, Iceland, France, Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Sweden and the Northern and Central United States.

The CanAm Highway comprises Saskatchewan Highways 35, SK Hwy 39, SK Hwy 6, SK Hwy 3, SK Hwy 2 and U.S. Route 85.  46.5 mi of SK Hwy 35 contribute to the CanAm Highway between Port of Oungre on the Canada – United States border and Weyburn.  Mudslides, and spring flooding were huge road building and maintenance problems around Nipawin as well as along the southern portion of the route named the \"Greater Yellow Grass Marsh\".  Over 20 early dams were built until the problem was addressed with the Rafferty-Alameda Project on the Souris River and the construction of the Qu'Appelle River Dam which have helped to eliminate washed out roads and flooded communities.  The highway through the homesteading community followed the Dominion Land Survey on the square until reaching the Saskatchewan River at Nipawin.  The completion of the combined railway and traffic bridge over the Saskatchewan River at Nipawin in the late 1920s retired the ferry and basket crossing for traffic north of Nipawin.  The E.B. Campbell Dam built in 1963 northeast of Nipawin created Tobin Lake, and Codette Lake was formed with the construction of the Francois-Finlay Hydroelectric dam at Nipawin.  The railway/traffic bridge that formed part of Highway 35 was the only crossing utilized at Nipawin until a new traffic bridge was constructed in 1974.  The new bridge then became part of the combined Highway 35 and 55 until the highway parts just east of White Fox.  Highway 35 then continued north along the west side of Tobin Lake.  The railway/traffic bridge continues to be utilized for one lane vehicle traffic controlled by traffic lights, and continues as the \"old highway 35\" on the west side of the river until it joins with the current Highway 35/55."}

Moose typically inhabit boreal forests and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates. Hunting and other human activities have caused a reduction in the size of the moose's range over time.  Moose have been reintroduced to some of their former habitats.  Currently, most moose are found in Canada, Alaska, New England, Fennoscandia, Baltic States, and Russia.  Their diet consists of both terrestrial and aquatic vegetation.  The most common moose predators are the gray wolf along with bears and humans. Unlike most other deer species, moose are solitary animals and do not form herds.

It's also known as Cipó Preto (black liana), Pagode caipira (rural pagode) or Pagode sertanejo (folk pagode).  Sertanejo means anything that comes from the back-country, outback or simply the countryside.  This style of music was pioneered by musicians Tião Carreiro and Lourival dos Santos in the late 1950s, when they fused the \"Coco\" and \"Calango de roda\" rhythms.  Although other instruments can be added, it is much characterized by its simple, acoustic approach, with the use of just one or two viola guitars, often accompanied by an acoustic guitar and, at times, a light percussion section.  A structural feature commonly used in this genre is the alternation of verses sung with the accompaniement of a classical guitar, with solos of viola caipira.  Pieces can be entirely instrumental or have one or two singers, usually: when there are two lead vocals (that can be men, women or a combination), they sing together on a steady interval.  The metrics used are usually of five or seven-syllable roundels, and in presentations, songs quite often are linked together, on a medley.  Another notable feature are its lyrics, that tend to portray the everyday life of country people, telling stories about simple life, nature, love, booze, animals and so on."}

{"title": "Leave Them Boys Alone", "passage": "\"Leave Them Boys Alone\" is a song recorded by American country music artist Hank Williams Jr. with Waylon Jennings and Ernest Tubb.  It was released in May 1983 as the second single from Williams' album \"Strong Stuff\".  The song reached number 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart.  It was written by Williams, Dean Dillon, Gary Stewart and Tanya Tucker.  The song is notable for its combination of two singers associated with the outlaw movement with a country legend from the honky tonk days and golden age of the Grand Ole Opry.  Outlaw singers like Williams and Jennings saw themselves as taking country music back to its raw, honky tonk roots, and recording an up tempo song with Tubb (who would never have received radio airplay in the late 1970s and early 80's) and reaching #6 was a slap in the face to the proponents of the country pop sound.  The lyrics of the song, much like Williams' \"Family Tradition\" echo the sentiment that the outlaw singers and their current escapades were predated by the hard living honky tonkers of the 1950s such as Hank Williams, Sr. and Ernest Tubb, prior to the music being fairly taken over by the Nashville Sound in the 1960s."}

During the First Balkan War, most of the Kosovo Vilayet was taken by Serbia, while the region of Metohija was taken by the Kingdom of Montenegro, its main allies.  Over the centuries, populations of ethnic Serbs and Albanians tended to shift following territorial handovers.  As a result of the multi-ethnic composition of Kosovo, the new administration provoked a mixed response from the local population.  Whilst according to Noel Malcolm the Albanians did not welcome Serbian rule, the non-Albanian population in the Kosovo Vilayet (predominantly Serbs) considered this a liberation.  Kosovo Vilayet was internationally recognised as a part of Serbia and northern Metohija as a part of Montenegro at the Treaty of London in May 1913.  In 1918, Serbia transformed into the newly Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later named Yugoslavia.  Disagreements regarding the territory of Macedonia among the members of the Balkan League led to the Second Balkan War.  Here, Serbia and Greece fought against Bulgaria in 1913.

Once the shaft is spinning fast enough, the working fluid (usually air) pushes the foil away from the shaft so that there is no contact.  The shaft and foil are separated by the air's high pressure which is generated by the rotation which pulls gas into the bearing via viscosity effects.  A high speed of the shaft with respect to the foil is required to initiate the air gap, and once this has been achieved, no wear occurs.  Unlike aerostatic or hydrostatic bearings, foil bearings require no external pressurisation system for the working fluid, so the hydrodynamic bearing is self-starting."}

Along with rock mechanics, soil mechanics provides the theoretical basis for analysis in geotechnical engineering, a subdiscipline of civil engineering, and engineering geology, a subdiscipline of geology.  Soil mechanics is used to analyze the deformations of and flow of fluids within natural and man-made structures that are supported on or made of soil, or structures that are buried in soils.

{"title": "The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life", "passage": "The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life is a 1956 sociology book by Erving Goffman, in which Goffman uses the imagery of the theatre in order to portray the importance of human social interaction.

{"title": "Dramaturgy (sociology)", "passage": "Dramaturgy is a sociological perspective commonly used in microsociological accounts of social interaction in everyday life.  The term was first adapted into sociology from the theatre by Erving Goffman, who developed most of the related terminology and ideas in his 1959 book, \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\".  Kenneth Burke, whom Goffman would later acknowledge as an influence, had earlier presented his notions of dramatism in 1945, which in turn derives from Shakespeare.  However, the fundamental difference between Burke's and Goffman's view is that Burke believed that life was in fact theatre, whereas Goffman viewed theatre as a metaphor.  If we imagine ourselves as directors observing what goes on in the theatre of everyday life, we are doing what Goffman called dramaturgical analysis, the study of social interaction in terms of theatrical performance."}
{"title": "Goffman (disambiguation)", "passage": "Erving Goffman (1922–1982) was a Canadian sociologist"}
{"title": "Identity Performance", "passage": "In everyday interactions, the body serves as a critical site of identity performance.  In conveying who we are to other people, we use our bodies to project information about ourselves.  This is done through movement, clothes, speech, and facial expressions.  What we put forward is our best effort at what we want to say about who we are.  Yet while we intend to convey one impression, our performance is not always interpreted as we might expect.  Through learning to make sense of others’ responses to our behavior, we can assess how well we have conveyed what we intended.  We can then alter our performance accordingly.  This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment is what Erving Goffman calls impression management.  Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation through their behavior.  People seek to define social situations by using contextual cues from the environment around them.  Social norms emerge from situational definitions, as people learn to read cues from the environment and the people present to understand what is appropriate behavior."}
{"title": "Identity management theory", "passage": "Identity management theory (also frequently referred to as IMT) is an intercultural communication theory from the 1990s.  It was developed by William R. Cupach and Tadasu Todd Imahori on the basis of Erving Goffman's \"Interaction ritual: Essays on face-to-face behavior\" (1967).  Cupach and Imahori distinguish between intercultural communication (speakers from different cultures) and intracultural communication (speakers sharing the same culture)."}
{"title": "Impression management", "passage": "Impression management is a conscious or subconscious process in which people attempt to influence the perceptions of other people about a person, object or event.  They do so by regulating and controlling information in social interaction.  It was first conceptualized by Erving Goffman in 1959, and then was expanded upon in 1967.  An example of impression management theory in play is in sports such as soccer.  At an important game, a player would want to showcase themselves in the best light possible, because there are college recruiters watching.  This person would have the flashiest pair of cleats and try and perform their best to show off their skills.  Their main goal may be to impress the college recruiters in a way that maximizes their chances of being chosen for a college team rather than winning the game."}
{"title": "Erving Goffman", "passage": "Erving Goffman (11 June 1922 – 19 November 1982) was a Canadian-American sociologist and writer, considered by some \"the most influential American sociologist of the twentieth century\".

{"title": "Ray Birdwhistell", "passage": "Ray Birdwhistell (September 28, 1918 – October 19, 1994) was an American anthropologist who founded kinesics as a field of inquiry and research.  Birdwhistell coined the term \"kinesics\", meaning \"facial expression, gestures, posture and gait, and visible arm and body movements\".  He estimated that \"no more than 30 to 35 percent of the social meaning of a conversation or an interaction is carried by the words.\"  Stated more broadly, he argued that \"words are not the only containers of social knowledge.\"  He proposed other technical terms, including kineme, and many others less frequently used today.  Birdwhistell had at least as much impact on the study of language and social interaction generally as just nonverbal communication because he was interested in the study of communication more broadly than is often recognized.  Birdwhistell understood body movements to be culturally patterned rather than universal.  His students were required to read widely, sources not only in communication but also anthropology and linguistics.  Collaborations with others, including initially Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, and later, Erving Goffman and Dell Hymes had huge influence on his work.  For example, the book he is best known for, \"Kinesics and Context\", \"would not have appeared if it had not been envisaged by Erving Goffman\" and he explicitly stated \"the paramount and sustaining influence upon my work has been that of anthropological linguistics\", a tradition most directly represented at the University of Pennsylvania by Hymes."}

{"title": "Imhoff tank", "passage": "The Imhoff tank, named for German engineer Karl Imhoff (1876–1965), is a chamber suitable for the reception and processing of sewage.  It may be used for the clarification of sewage by simple settling and sedimentation, along with anaerobic digestion of the extracted sludge.  It consists of an upper chamber in which sedimentation takes place, from which collected solids slide down inclined bottom slopes to an entrance into a lower chamber in which the sludge is collected and digested.  The two chambers are otherwise unconnected, with sewage flowing only through the upper sedimentation chamber and no flow of sewage in the lower digestion chamber.  The lower chamber requires separate biogas vents and pipes for the removal of digested sludge, typically after 6-9 months of digestion.  The Imhoff tank is in effect a two-story septic tank and retains the septic tank's simplicity while eliminating many of its drawbacks, which largely result from the mixing of fresh sewage and septic sludge in the same chamber."}

{"title": "Governance of England", "passage": "There has not been a government of England since 1707 when the Kingdom of England ceased to exist as a sovereign state, as it merged with the Kingdom of Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.  Kingdom of Great Britain continued from 1707 until 1801 when it merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which itself became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) in 1922 (in reality; in name in 1927) upon independence for most of the island of Ireland.  The UK since then has gone through significant change to its system of government, with devolved parliaments, assemblies and governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  England, however, remains under the full jurisdiction, on all matters, of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the UK government as no devolved administration has been created for England within the new structure.  This situation has led to the anomaly, known as the West Lothian question, which is that Scottish Members of Parliament (MPs) are able to vote on legislation that affects only England whereas English MPs can not vote on certain Scottish matters due to devolution.  In some cases, such as top-up university tuition fees and foundation hospitals, the votes of Scottish MPs have been crucial in helping pass legislation for England that the majority of English MPs have opposed."}

Many statutes are important to understanding the governance of the province, but nowhere are they consolidated into a single document or even a list.  The office of Attorney-General at one time suggested 23 acts which might be included, but cautioned that this was not a \"definitive list\".  However, since Alberta is a part of federation, its powers are clearly delineated in law, via the Constitution of Canada."}

{"title": "Irish measure", "passage": "Irish measure or plantation measure was a system of units of land measurement used in Ireland from the 16th century plantations until the 19th century, with residual use into the 20th century.  The units were based on \"English measure\" but used a linear perch measuring 7 yard as opposed to the English rod of 5.5 yard .  Thus, linear units such as the furlong and mile, which were defined in terms of perches, were longer by a factor of 14:11 (~27% more) in Irish measure, while areas such as the rood or acre were larger by 196:121 (~62% more).  After the Act of Union 1800, Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, whose Parliament passed the Weights and Measures Act 1824, which established English measure in Ireland as \"Imperial measure\" or \"statute measure\".  Imperial measure soon replaced Irish measure in the use of the Dublin Castle administration, but Irish measure persisted in local government, and longer still in private use.  A third system, \"Scotch measure\" or \"Cunningham measure\", was also used in Ulster Scots areas."}

{"title": "Canada under British rule", "passage": "Canada first came under British rule with the Treaty of Paris (1763) which ceded New France, of which Canada was a part, to the British Empire.  Gradually, other territories, colonies, and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada.  The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas.  With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada.  Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.  A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation.  Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949.  Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.  This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom, and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  Canada's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act, subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom."}

It was also used by the Auckland Provincial Council, with Auckland Province owning the building from 1858.  After the abolition of the provincial government system, the building was used by government's survey department and was then used by Auckland University College.  The General Assembly House was demolished in 1917 to make way for Anzac Avenue.  Today, a reserve adjacent to Parliament Street commemorates the location where New Zealand Parliament met initially."}
{"title": "Politics of Canada", "passage": "The politics of Canada function within a framework of parliamentary democracy and a federal system of parliamentary government with strong democratic traditions.  Canada is a constitutional monarchy, in which the Monarch is head of state.  The country has a multi-party system in which many of its legislative practices derive from the unwritten conventions of and precedents set by the United Kingdom's Westminster Parliament.  However, Canada has evolved variations: party discipline in Canada is stronger than in the United Kingdom and more parliamentary votes are considered motions of confidence, which tends to diminish the role of non-Cabinet Members of Parliament, (MPs).  Such members, in the government caucus, and junior or lower-profile members of opposition caucuses, are known as backbenchers. Backbenchers can, however, exert their influence by sitting in parliamentary committees, like the Public Accounts Committee or the National-Defence Committee."}

The NHL first expanded into the United States in 1924 with the founding of the Boston Bruins, and by 1926 consisted of ten teams in Ontario, Quebec, the Great Lakes region, and the Northeastern United States.

{"title": "Waiting for Happiness", "passage": "Waiting for Happiness (original title: Heremakono) is a 2002 drama film written and directed by Abderrahmane Sissako.  Main characters are a student, who has returned to his home in Nouadhibou, an electrician and his child apprentice, and the local women.  The film is characterized by a succession of scenes of the daily life of the characters which are unique to their particular African and Arab cultures, while borrowing from tropes of Tayeb Saleh's Season of Migration to the North (موسم الهجرة إلى الشمال).  The viewer must interpret the scenes without much help from narrator or plot, while the structure of the film hangs on a series of mundane but visually arresting moments, many of which are repeated in other works in Abderrahmane Sissako's opus, including scenes at a barber shop and a photo booth, also present in his earlier La Vie Sur Terre and later Timbuktu.  The film presents typical Mauritanian moments of beauty, struggle, alienation, and humor, which are experienced by groups socially divided from each other, such as Bidhan women drinking tea and gossiping, West African migrants passing through Mauritania to get to Europe (and finding an unsuccessful comrade washed ashore).  The young protagonist who has returned interacts with all of these groups as an outsider, as he struggles to remember even his own Hassaniya Arabic dialect, but prefers instead French.  Many of the themes and characters presage Sissako's 2014 film Timbuktu, and both explore liminal Sahel identities authentically situated in everyday life.  Waiting for Happiness premiered at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section."}

The first \"attestation\" of it in writing was by a Bavarian captive of the Mongols, but it is present in the national folklore of Chechens and Ingush and of Circassians.  The male almaz is said to be hairy and hideous, and have an axe embedded in its chest, while the female is very beautiful with large breasts and golden hair, and has a \"favorite pastime\" of dancing naked at night under the moon.  The almaz is said to have magical powers residing in its hair, but if the hair is removed or even grabbed, it may be rendered helpless.  It has been theoried by some to have arisen under Mongolian influence, either during the Mongol invasions of Dzurdzuketia or the intervening period where the northern Dzurdzuk state of Simsir was subjugated to the Mongol-controlled Golden Horde.  The word \"almaz\" is a loan from Mongolian where it originally meant \"forest man\".  Amjad Jaimoukha however suggested that the name \"almaz\" may have started to have been used by North Caucasians for an already existent native concept during the sojourn of the Golden Horde of Simsir."}

Form criticism and tradition criticism thus overlap, though the former is more narrow in focus.  Tradition history is connected with secular folklore studies, especially Axel Olrik's analysis of Scandinavian folklore and the \"laws\" which he established concerning the nature of such folklore.  The stories in the Bible were then analyzed on the basis of these \"laws\"."}

Target's Australian division pulled the game from their 300 stores following a Change.org petition that claimed the game \"encourages players to commit sexual violence and kill women\", despite the petition being criticised as misleading and portrayals of sexual violence in games already illegal in Australia."}

In the early years it had state units and members in ten provinces of India, and significant mass work.  From the 1990s, there was a decline, partly because many of its members were unable to do serious teamwork; and partly because the dogmatic style of Magan Desai, a powerful figure in the strongest state unit, Gujarat, clashed with other members who wanted a more open and non-sectarian functioning.  In addition, many ex-Stalinist and ex-Maoists were recruited, and one faction in West Bengal showed that they had simply replaced the Stalin-Mao cult by the Trotsky cult.  By the end of the 1990s, the ICS was a much shrunken organisation.  The final crisis came after the Gujarat carnage of 2002, when a faction around Desai attacked the most well-known anti-communal and civil rights activist members of the party as self-seeking individuals.  The Conference of 2003 saw Gujarat, led by Desai, rejecting a delegate session, so it was unclear how many members were actually in ICS.  The West Bengal unit, along with several Gujarat members, left.  It is uncertain whether Desai had an actual majority with him, but he continued to call his rump organisation ICS.

{"title": "Lonesome Pine Fiddlers", "passage": "The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers (1938- 1966) were an early bluegrass band which included such notable \"first generation\" bluegrass musicians as Ezra Cline, Bobby Osborne, Paul Williams, Melvin Goins, Charlie Cline, Curly Ray Cline, Larry Richardson and for a short time Jimmy Martin.  The group was started by Ezra Cline and Curly Ray Cline and was originally named \"Cousin Ezra and the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers\".  The Clines came from a large family consisting of musically talented people.  Ray and Charlie's father, Charlie, was a talented banjo player and the women in the family, Geraldine and Bobbi, were great singers.  For reasons unknown, Bobbi and Geraldine never joined the band on the road but often joined in at home, especially when notable Country singers, such as Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, and Hank Williams, came visiting.  None of them ever had a music lesson yet excelled on every instrument they touched.  Natives of the Gilbert Creek region of southern West Virginia, Cousin Ezra, along with brothers Ireland (Lazy Ned) and Curly Ray Cline, were part of the original Lonesome Pine Fiddlers from about 1938, a group that worked on radio at WHIS Bluefield, West Virginia.  During World War II, Ned was killed in action.  When the Pine Fiddlers resumed regular daily broadcasts, Charlie, who played multiple instruments, joined them on a regular basis.  Charlie returned to the Fiddlers briefly before becoming a member of Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys.  During 1952-1955, Charlie worked off and on with Monroe, recording some 38 songs, all on Decca.  It has been said that he played every instrument at one time or another in the Monroe group except mandolin.  Charlie spent most of 1953 back with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers working at WJR radio in Detroit.  When Ezra brought the band to Pikeville, Kentucky, in November, Charlie rejoined Bill Monroe.  In 1954, Charlie did a session, playing lead guitar, with the Stanley Brothers and also another one on RCA with the Fiddlers, although he was not otherwise working with them at the time.  He also worked briefly as a sideman with the Osborne Brothers, although he did not record with them.  By 1958, Charlie (electric lead guitar) and his wife, Lee (electric bass), had rejoined Ezra and Curly Ray in the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, who were experimenting with a more modern sound and working a TV show in Huntington, West Virginia, in addition to daily radio in Pikeville.  In his later years, Charlie was with the Stanley Brothers.  Curly Ray also played with the Stanley Brothers at a different time as their fiddler.  Curly Ray was one of the best fiddlers in Bluegrass.  This most talented family of musicians were the best, surpassed by none.  Finally, on October 1, 2009, The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers got their due when they were inducted into the International Bluegrass Hall of Fame at the Ryman Theater (the original home of the Grand Ole Opry).  Bobby Osborne, Melvin Goins and Paul Williams were there to receive the bands award.  In the crowd of a sold out theater was the son of Ezra Cline, Scotty Ireland Cline, who recalled being in that same theater as a child sitting on stage and watching the Fiddlers play.  (At the time, the Opry had bleachers for family just off stage).  The final act of the evening at the IBMA Awards was the playing of \"Pain in my Heart\" by Osborne, Goins and Williams along with a Song from the Dillards, who were also inducted the same evening."}

His father, William Murphy (1829–1911), was both a fiddle player and maker, indeed John was the proud owner of an instrument that had been made by his father.  John’s father was his first fiddle teacher.  His siblings, a brother and three sisters, also played the instrument but their interest in music waned as they reached adulthood and they did not continue to play.  John’s musical literacy was also gained primarily from his father, who had learnt to read music at a hedge school at Ballygrace in the locality taught by a Thomas Croke.  The same Thomas Croke, many years later, stayed for long periods of time in the Murphy household and would undoubtedly also have taught the young John directly."}

{"title": "Sikh art and culture", "passage": "The Sikhs are adherents to Sikhism the fifth largest organized religion in the world, with around 23 million adherents.  Sikh History is around 500 years and in that time the Sikhs have developed unique expressions of art and culture which are influenced by their faith and synthesize traditions from many other cultures.  Sikhism is Punjab's only indigenous religion with all other religions coming from outside Punjab (with the possible exception of Punjabi Hinduism since the oldest Hindu scripture – the Rig Veda – was composed in the Punjab region.  Some other religions, like Jainism, may also claim to have originated in Punjab since Jain symbolism has been found among artifacts of the Indus Valley Civilization).  All the Sikh gurus, saints and majority of the martyrs in Sikh history were from Punjab and from the Punjabi people.  Punjabi culture and Sikhism are considered inseparably intertwined.  \"Sikh\" properly refers to adherents of Sikhism as a religion, not an ethnic group.  However, because Sikhism has seldom sought converts, most Sikhs share strong ethno-religious ties.  Many countries, such as the U.K., therefore recognize Sikh as a designated ethnicity on their censuses.  The American non-profit organization United Sikhs has fought to have Sikh included on the U.S. census as well, arguing that Sikhs \"self-identify as an 'ethnic minority'\" and believe \"that they are more than just a religion\"."}
