{"title": "Ford flathead V8 engine", "passage": "The Ford flathead V8 (often called simply the Ford flathead, flathead Ford, or flatty when the context is implicit, such as in hot-rodding) is a V8 engine of the valve-in-block type designed by the Ford Motor Company and built by Ford and various licensees.  During the engine's first decade of production, when overhead-valve engines were rare, it was usually known simply as the Ford V‑8, and the first car model in which it was installed, the Model 18, was (and still is) often called simply the \"Ford V‑8\", after its new engine.  Although the V8 configuration was not new when the Ford V8 was introduced in 1932, the latter was a market first in the respect that it made an 8-cylinder affordable and a V engine affordable to the emerging mass market consumer for the first time.  It was the first independently designed and built V8 engine produced by Ford for mass production, and it ranks as one of the company's most important developments.  A fascination with ever-more-powerful engines was perhaps the most salient aspect of the American car and truck market for a half century, from 1923 until 1973.  The Ford flathead V8 was perfectly in tune with the cultural moment of its introduction, leading the way into a future of which the Ford company was a principal architect.  Thus it became a phenomenal success.  The engine design, with various changes but no major ones, was installed in Ford passenger cars and trucks until 1953, making the engine's 21-year production run for the U.S. consumer market longer than the 19-year run of the Ford Model T engine for that market.  The engine was on Ward's list of the 10 best engines of the 20th century.

They tend to be associated with wet soils, many growing in shallow water, in wetlands, or in wet savannas like flatwoods.  In wet soils, their abundance appears to be related to water levels, fire frequency, and competition from other plants such as grasses.  Experiments have shown that they are weak competitors compared to many other wetland plant species.  Some species can persist as buried seeds during unfavorable conditions.

{"title": "Musical composition", "passage": "Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music.  People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.

{"title": "Penrose process", "passage": "The Penrose process (also called Penrose mechanism) is a process theorised by Roger Penrose wherein energy can be extracted from a rotating black hole.  That extraction is made possible because the rotational energy of the black hole is located not inside the event horizon of the black hole, but on the outside of it in a region of the Kerr spacetime called the ergosphere, a region in which a particle is necessarily propelled in locomotive concurrence with the rotating spacetime.  All objects in the ergosphere become dragged by a rotating spacetime.  In the process, a lump of matter enters into the ergosphere of the black hole, and once it enters the ergosphere, it is forcibly split into two parts.  For example, the matter might be made of two parts that separate by firing an explosive or rocket which pushes its halves apart.  The momentum of the two pieces of matter when they separate can be arranged so that one piece escapes from the black hole (it \"escapes to infinity\"), whilst the other falls past the event horizon into the black hole.  With careful arrangement, the escaping piece of matter can be made to have greater mass-energy than the original piece of matter, and the infalling piece has negative mass-energy.  Although momentum is conserved the effect is that more energy can be extracted than was originally provided, the difference being provided by the black hole itself.  In summary, the process results in a slight decrease in the angular momentum of the black hole, which corresponds to a transference of energy to the matter.  The momentum lost is converted to energy extracted.", "qa": [{"question": "What is the Penrose process also called?", "answer": "The Penrose process is also called the Penrose mechanism."}, {"question": "Who theorised the Penrose process?", "answer": "Roger Penrose theorised the Penrose process."}, {"question": "What is the Penrose process a process of?", "answer": "The Penrose process is a process of energy extraction from a rotating black hole."}, {"question": "Where is the rotational energy of a black hole located?", "answer": "The rotational energy of a black hole is located on the outside of it in a region of the Kerr spacetime called the ergosphere."}, {"question": "What happens to objects in the ergosphere of a rotating spacetime?", "answer": "Objects in the ergosphere of a rotating spacetime become dragged by the rotating spacetime."}, {"question": "What happens to matter when it enters the ergosphere of a black hole?", "answer": "Matter when it enters the ergosphere of a black hole is forcibly split into two parts."}, {"question": "How can the momentum of the two pieces of matter be arranged?", "answer": "The momentum of the two pieces of matter can be arranged so that one piece escapes from the black hole, whilst the other falls past the event horizon into the black hole."}, {"question": "What can be made to have greater mass-energy than the original piece of matter?", "answer": "The escaping piece of matter can be made to have greater mass-energy than the original piece of matter."}, {"question": "What is the result of the process?", "answer": "The result of the process is a slight decrease in the angular momentum of the black hole, which corresponds to a transference of energy to the matter."}, {"question": "What is converted to energy extracted?", "answer": "The momentum lost is converted to energy extracted."}]}

The coalition is made up of approximately 40 Islamist parties and groups.  The coalition has called upon the opposition to break ties with figures they call \"corrupt\" from the Mubarak regime.  Notably, the political wing of the group (the Building and Development Party) and the Wasat Party did not take part in protests held by pro-Morsi forces during the week of 18 October 2013.  The alliance offered a new reconciliation initiative that does not include the reinstatement of Morsi on 26 October 2013; al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Homeland Party are not calling for the reinstatement of Morsi, while the Virtue Party, Authenticity Party and the Muslim Brotherhood are still demanding that Morsi be reinstated as president.  The group has reached out to what it called \"fellow revolutionaries\" to cooperate with them against the protest law in Egypt in order to jointly organize protests; Kefaya objected to the call for cooperation.  Members of the Building and Development Party, the political arm of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, wanted to meet with Yasser Al Borhamy, the deputy head of the Salafist Call as well as Emad Abdel Ghaffour, who is the head of the Homeland Party.  Al Borhamy reportedly could not meet with the members, while Ghaffour asked them to stop demonstrations before talks could begin and rebuffed their demands for the reinstatement of Morsi and the bringing back of the Shura Council that was dissolved.  Borhami denied being asked to serve as a mediator, though he stated that he would act as a mediator if there were no preconditions.

{"title": "Billboard Year-End", "passage": "\"Billboard\" Year-End charts are a cumulative measure of a single or album's performance in the United States, based upon the \"Billboard\" magazine charts during any given chart year.  \"Billboard's\" \"chart year\" runs from the first Billboard \"week\" of December to the final week in November, but because the Billboard week is dated in advance of publication, the last calendar week for which sales are counted is usually the third week in November.  This altered calendar allows for \"Billboard\" to calculate year-end charts and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of December.  Prior to incorporating chart data from Nielsen SoundScan (from 1991), year-end charts were calculated by an inverse-point system based solely on a title's performance (for example a single appearing on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 would be given one point for a week spent at position 100, two points for a week spent at position ninety-nine, and so forth, up to 100 points for each week spent at number one).  Other factors including the total weeks a song spent on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into its year-end total.  The same method was used for albums based on the \"Billboard\" 200, and songs appearing on the other charts (e.g. Hot Country Singles).", "qa": [{"question": "What is Billboard Year-End?", "answer": "Billboard Year-End charts are a cumulative measure of a single or album's performance in the United States, based upon the 'Billboard' magazine charts during any given chart year."}, {"question": "What is the chart year for Billboard?", "answer": "The chart year for Billboard runs from the first Billboard week of December to the final week in November."}, {"question": "Why does Billboard's chart year run from December to November?", "answer": "Billboard's chart year runs from December to November because the Billboard week is dated in advance of publication, and the last calendar week for which sales are counted is usually the third week in November."}, {"question": "How are year-end charts calculated by Billboard?", "answer": "Prior to incorporating chart data from Nielsen SoundScan (from 1991), year-end charts were calculated by an inverse-point system based solely on a title's performance."}, {"question": "What factors are calculated into a song's year-end total?", "answer": "The same method was used for albums based on the 'Billboard' 200, and songs appearing on the other charts (e.g. Hot Country Singles)."}, {"question": "What is the method used for calculating year-end charts for albums?", "answer": "The same method was used for albums based on the 'Billboard' 200, and songs appearing on the other charts (e.g. Hot Country Singles)."}]}
{"title": "Psycho Circus World Tour", "passage": "Psycho Circus World Tour was a Kiss concert tour in 1998–2000.  It was the first concert tour in history to have 3-D visual effects.  The Smashing Pumpkins opened at the Dodger Stadium show only, in costume as The Beatles for the Halloween night performance.  The Dodger Stadium show was streamed live on the internet as well as a radio broadcast.  Two songs, \"Psycho Circus\" and \"Shout It Out Loud\", were screened live on Fox television as part of the \"Kiss Live: The Ultimate Halloween Party\" special.  The vast majority of songs in the setlist were played on the previous Alive/Worldwide concert dates, leading to some frustration from fans expecting the return of classic songs not played on the previous tour.  Peter Criss was quoted in Metal Edge magazine at the time as wanting to add \"Parasite\" to the setlist.  The tour was initially hyped as having circus-style acts as pre-show entertainment.  This ultimately happened only at the first concert at Dodger Stadium.  Peter Criss later said that it didn't work out because the circus performers wanted equal billing and that some had even wanted to use KISS' backstage dressing room.  \"2,000 Man\" was played to bring in the new Millennium at the 1999/2000 New Year's Eve show at Vancouver, advertised at the time as being recorded for Alive IV.  The Vancouver show was also notable as being the first time the original members had played non-original band era material live in concert – \"I Love It Loud\", \"Lick It Up\" and \"Heaven's on Fire\" were added to the setlist and subsequently played on the Farewell Tour.  \"Forever\" was listed on concert setlists at the Vancouver show but was not played.  It was thought at the time it may have been intended as a Paul Stanley solo version prior to \"Black Diamond\".  One notable show on the tour was the March 12 Bremen, Germany, show.  After the opening song, Paul Stanley announced that the local fire marshall had banned Kiss from using any pyrotechnics during the show.  They used a translator on stage to let the crowd understand exactly what Stanley was saying.  At the end of the performance, the band ignited all of the pyrotechnics at once; as a result, they were banned from performing in Bremen.  Ticket sales for this tour were notably slower than the previous Reunion Tour, with many of the smaller market shows underselling and a second North American leg for the summer of 1999 cancelled all together, the band ultimatly decided on embarking on a Farewell tour in the new millennium.", "qa": [{"question": "What was the name of the Kiss concert tour in 1998-2000?", "answer": "Psycho Circus World Tour"}, {"question": "What was notable about the Psycho Circus World Tour?", "answer": "It was the first concert tour in history to have 3-D visual effects."}, {"question": "Who opened for Kiss at the Dodger Stadium show?", "answer": "The Smashing Pumpkins"}, {"question": "What was unique about the Smashing Pumpkins' performance at the Dodger Stadium show?", "answer": "They performed in costume as The Beatles for the Halloween night performance."}, {"question": "How was the Dodger Stadium show broadcast?", "answer": "It was streamed live on the internet as well as a radio broadcast."}, {"question": "What songs were screened live on Fox television as part of the 'Kiss Live: The Ultimate Halloween Party' special?", "answer": "Psycho Circus and Shout It Out Loud"}, {"question": "What was the reaction of fans to the setlist of the Psycho Circus World Tour?", "answer": "The vast majority of songs in the setlist were played on the previous Alive/Worldwide concert dates, leading to some frustration from fans expecting the return of classic songs not played on the previous tour."}, {"question": "What was Peter Criss quoted as wanting to add to the setlist?", "answer": "Parasite"}, {"question": "What happened to the circus-style acts as pre-show entertainment?", "answer": "It ultimately happened only at the first concert at Dodger Stadium."}, {"question": "Why did the circus performers want equal billing?", "answer": "Because some had even wanted to use KISS' backstage dressing room."}, {"question": "What song was played to bring in the new Millennium at the 1999/2000 New Year's Eve show at Vancouver?", "answer": "2,000 Man"}, {"question": "What was notable about the Vancouver show?", "answer": "It was the first time the original members had played non-original band era material live in concert – I Love It Loud, Lick It Up, and Heaven's on Fire were added to the setlist and subsequently played on the Farewell Tour."}, {"question": "What song was listed on concert setlists at the Vancouver show but was not played?", "answer": "Forever"}, {"question": "What happened at the March 12 Bremen, Germany, show?", "answer": "After the opening song, Paul Stanley announced that the local fire marshall had banned Kiss from using any pyrotechnics during the show."}, {"question": "What was the result of the band igniting all of the pyrotechnics at once at the end of the performance?", "answer": "They were banned from performing in Bremen."}, {"question": "Why did the band decide to embark on a Farewell tour in the new millennium?", "answer": "Because ticket sales for this tour were notably slower than the previous Reunion Tour, with many of the smaller market shows underselling and a second North American leg for the summer of 1999 cancelled all together."}]}

Alongside Lincoln Thompson, \"preps\" Lewis, and Devon Russell, Cedric Myton formed \"The Tartans\" in 1968, the group released many 45\" singles, and had early success in 1969 with the hit 45 \"Dance All Night\".  After a couple of years The Tartans disbanded, and Myton alongside Lincoln \"Prince\" Thompson, formed \"The Royal Rasses\".  Cedric Myton spent almost 3 years alongside Thompson, writing the tracks which would constitute the Royal Rasses album \"Humanity\".  Cedric Myton also sang on every track on the album \"Humanity\".  This album was a big success, although Cedric Myton left The Royal Rasses shortly after the release of \"Humanity\", his beautiful falsetto tones on every track, undoubtedly brought many fans to the attention of \"The Royal Rasses\" and the band continued without Cedric Myton, who went on to form \"The Congos\", alongside Roydel Johnson, who had a rich \"tenor\" and Watty Burnett who provided a \"Deep Barritone\", which combined with Cedric Mytons rich \"Falsetto\" anchored The Congos, whose music is easily distinguishable and highly regarded in not just reggae circles but worldwide.  Unfortunately, due to both a dispute between the producer Lee\"Scratch\"Perry and Island Records favouritism of Bob Marley,the great first release LP from The Congos \"Heart Of The Congos\" was \"Shelved\" because it was deemed \"a strong album\" and Island Records.led by Chris Blackwell felt \"Heart Of The Congos\" would take away the limelight from Bob Marley.  Many years later the English group \"The Beat\" released \"Heart Of The Congos\" on their own \"Go-Feat\" label, as did the company \"Blood And Fire\", and \"Heart Of The Congos\" was a big success,and rightly so, however it has to be said that had the album been released when it was first recorded it would have been a massive success.  Instead it was released initially in very limited numbers on Lee Perry's \"Black Art\" label and Perry re-mixed the album adding various external sounds, such as \"cow Horns\" provided by the barritoned Burnett.  They recorded the album \"Heart of the Congos\", with Lee Perry at the controls, producing what is widely considered one of the great classics of reggae.  Later Myton pursued a solo career.  After some time, the Congos reformed and recorded an album titled, \"Back in the Black Ark\".

{"title": "Pagode (music)", "passage": "Pagode is a type of Brazilian country-folk traditional style of music.  It's also known as Cipó Preto (black liana), Pagode caipira (rural pagode) or Pagode sertanejo (folk pagode).  Sertanejo means anything that comes from the back-country, outback or simply the countryside.  This style of music was pioneered by musicians Tião Carreiro and Lourival dos Santos in the late 1950s, when they fused the \"Coco\" and \"Calango de roda\" rhythms.  Although other instruments can be added, it is much characterized by its simple, acoustic approach, with the use of just one or two viola guitars, often accompanied by an acoustic guitar and, at times, a light percussion section.  A structural feature commonly used in this genre is the alternation of verses sung with the accompaniement of a classical guitar, with solos of viola caipira.  Pieces can be entirely instrumental or have one or two singers, usually: when there are two lead vocals (that can be men, women or a combination), they sing together on a steady interval.  The metrics used are usually of five or seven-syllable roundels, and in presentations, songs quite often are linked together, on a medley.  Another notable feature are its lyrics, that tend to portray the everyday life of country people, telling stories about simple life, nature, love, booze, animals and so on.", "qa": [{"question": "What is Pagode, a type of music?", "answer": "Pagode is a type of Brazilian country-folk traditional style of music."}, {"question": "What are other names for Pagode?", "answer": "Pagode is also known as Cipó Preto, Pagode caipira, or Pagode sertanejo."}, {"question": "Who pioneered the style of music?", "answer": "Tião Carreiro and Lourival dos Santos pioneered the style of music in the late 1950s."}, {"question": "What instruments are typically used in Pagode?", "answer": "The instruments typically used in Pagode are viola guitars, acoustic guitar, and light percussion section."}, {"question": "What is a structural feature of Pagode?", "answer": "A structural feature commonly used in Pagode is the alternation of verses sung with the accompaniment of a classical guitar, with solos of viola caipira."}, {"question": "What is the typical format of a Pagode piece?", "answer": "Pieces can be entirely instrumental or have one or two singers, usually singing together on a steady interval."}, {"question": "What are the typical metrics used in Pagode?", "answer": "The metrics used are usually of five or seven-syllable roundels."}, {"question": "What is a notable feature of Pagode lyrics?", "answer": "The lyrics tend to portray the everyday life of country people, telling stories about simple life, nature, love, booze, animals, and so on."}, {"question": "What is the typical theme of Pagode lyrics?", "answer": "The typical theme of Pagode lyrics is the everyday life of country people, telling stories about simple life, nature, love, booze, animals, and so on."}]}

{"title": "Leave Them Boys Alone", "passage": "\"Leave Them Boys Alone\" is a song recorded by American country music artist Hank Williams Jr. with Waylon Jennings and Ernest Tubb.

It was written by Williams, Dean Dillon, Gary Stewart and Tanya Tucker.  The song is notable for its combination of two singers associated with the outlaw movement with a country legend from the honky tonk days and golden age of the Grand Ole Opry.  Outlaw singers like Williams and Jennings saw themselves as taking country music back to its raw, honky tonk roots, and recording an up tempo song with Tubb (who would never have received radio airplay in the late 1970s and early 80's) and reaching #6 was a slap in the face to the proponents of the country pop sound.  The lyrics of the song, much like Williams' \"Family Tradition\" echo the sentiment that the outlaw singers and their current escapades were predated by the hard living honky tonkers of the 1950s such as Hank Williams, Sr. and Ernest Tubb, prior to the music being fairly taken over by the Nashville Sound in the 1960s.", "qa": [{"question": "Who recorded the song 'Leave Them Boys Alone'?", "answer": "Hank Williams Jr. with Waylon Jennings and Ernest Tubb recorded the song 'Leave Them Boys Alone'."}, {"question": "When was the song 'Leave Them Boys Alone' released?", "answer": "The song 'Leave Them Boys Alone' was released in May 1983."}, {"question": "What was the chart position of the song 'Leave Them Boys Alone'?", "answer": "The song 'Leave Them Boys Alone' reached number 6 on the 'Billboard' Hot Country Singles chart."}, {"question": "Who wrote the song 'Leave Them Boys Alone'?", "answer": "The song 'Leave Them Boys Alone' was written by Hank Williams, Dean Dillon, Gary Stewart, and Tanya Tucker."}, {"question": "What is notable about the song 'Leave Them Boys Alone'?", "answer": "The song 'Leave Them Boys Alone' is notable for its combination of two singers associated with the outlaw movement with a country legend from the honky tonk days and golden age of the Grand Ole Opry."}, {"question": "What is the sentiment expressed in the lyrics of the song 'Leave Them Boys Alone'?", "answer": "The lyrics of the song 'Leave Them Boys Alone' echo the sentiment that the outlaw singers and their current escapades were predated by the hard living honky tonkers of the 1950s such as Hank Williams, Sr. and Ernest Tubb, prior to the music being fairly taken over by the Nashville Sound in the 1960s."}]}

{"title": "Serbia in the Balkan Wars", "passage": "The Kingdom of Serbia was one of the main parties in the Balkan Wars (8 October 1912 – 18 July 1913), victorious in both phases.  It gained significant territorial areas of the Central Balkans and almost doubled its territory.  During the First Balkan War, most of the Kosovo Vilayet was taken by Serbia, while the region of Metohija was taken by the Kingdom of Montenegro, its main allies.  Over the centuries, populations of ethnic Serbs and Albanians tended to shift following territorial handovers.  As a result of the multi-ethnic composition of Kosovo, the new administration provoked a mixed response from the local population.  Whilst according to Noel Malcolm the Albanians did not welcome Serbian rule, the non-Albanian population in the Kosovo Vilayet (predominantly Serbs) considered this a liberation.  Kosovo Vilayet was internationally recognised as a part of Serbia and northern Metohija as a part of Montenegro at the Treaty of London in May 1913.  In 1918, Serbia transformed into the newly Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later named Yugoslavia.  Disagreements regarding the territory of Macedonia among the members of the Balkan League led to the Second Balkan War.  Here, Serbia and Greece fought against Bulgaria in 1913.  Finalisations concerning which country took which parts were ratified at the Treaty of Bucharest the same year.

Once the shaft is spinning fast enough, the working fluid (usually air) pushes the foil away from the shaft so that there is no contact.  The shaft and foil are separated by the air's high pressure which is generated by the rotation which pulls gas into the bearing via viscosity effects.  A high speed of the shaft with respect to the foil is required to initiate the air gap, and once this has been achieved, no wear occurs.

{"title": "Identity Performance", "passage": "In everyday interactions, the body serves as a critical site of identity performance.  In conveying who we are to other people, we use our bodies to project information about ourselves.  This is done through movement, clothes, speech, and facial expressions.  What we put forward is our best effort at what we want to say about who we are.  Yet while we intend to convey one impression, our performance is not always interpreted as we might expect.  Through learning to make sense of others’ responses to our behavior, we can assess how well we have conveyed what we intended.  We can then alter our performance accordingly.  This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment is what Erving Goffman calls impression management.  Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation through their behavior.  People seek to define social situations by using contextual cues from the environment around them.  Social norms emerge from situational definitions, as people learn to read cues from the environment and the people present to understand what is appropriate behavior.", "qa": [{"question": "What is identity performance?", "answer": "In everyday interactions, the body serves as a critical site of identity performance."}, {"question": "What do we use to project information about ourselves?", "answer": "We use our bodies to project information about ourselves through movement, clothes, speech, and facial expressions."}, {"question": "What is the goal of identity performance?", "answer": "The goal of identity performance is to project what we want to say about who we are."}, {"question": "Why is identity performance not always interpreted as intended?", "answer": "Identity performance is not always interpreted as intended because what we put forward is not always interpreted as we might expect."}, {"question": "What is the process of impression management?", "answer": "The process of impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation through their behavior."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of situational definitions?", "answer": "The purpose of situational definitions is to define social situations by using contextual cues from the environment around them."}, {"question": "What emerges from situational definitions?", "answer": "Social norms emerge from situational definitions, as people learn to read cues from the environment and the people present to understand what is appropriate behavior."}]}

{"title": "Ray Birdwhistell", "passage": "Ray Birdwhistell (September 28, 1918 – October 19, 1994) was an American anthropologist who founded kinesics as a field of inquiry and research.  Birdwhistell coined the term \"kinesics\", meaning \"facial expression, gestures, posture and gait, and visible arm and body movements\".  He estimated that \"no more than 30 to 35 percent of the social meaning of a conversation or an interaction is carried by the words.\"  Stated more broadly, he argued that \"words are not the only containers of social knowledge.\"  He proposed other technical terms, including kineme, and many others less frequently used today.  Birdwhistell had at least as much impact on the study of language and social interaction generally as just nonverbal communication because he was interested in the study of communication more broadly than is often recognized.  Birdwhistell understood body movements to be culturally patterned rather than universal.  His students were required to read widely, sources not only in communication but also anthropology and linguistics.  Collaborations with others, including initially Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, and later, Erving Goffman and Dell Hymes had huge influence on his work.  For example, the book he is best known for, \"Kinesics and Context\", \"would not have appeared if it had not been envisaged by Erving Goffman\" and he explicitly stated \"the paramount and sustaining influence upon my work has been that of anthropological linguistics\", a tradition most directly represented at the University of Pennsylvania by Hymes.", "qa": [{"question": "Who founded kinesics as a field of inquiry and research?", "answer": "Ray Birdwhistell founded kinesics as a field of inquiry and research."}, {"question": "What does the term 'kinesics' mean?", "answer": "The term 'kinesics' means 'facial expression, gestures, posture and gait, and visible arm and body movements'."}, {"question": "What percentage of social meaning is carried by words, according to Ray Birdwhistell?", "answer": "According to Ray Birdwhistell, no more than 30 to 35 percent of the social meaning of a conversation or an interaction is carried by the words."}, {"question": "What is the broader field of study that Ray Birdwhistell was interested in?", "answer": "Ray Birdwhistell was interested in the study of communication more broadly than is often recognized."}, {"question": "How did Ray Birdwhistell understand body movements?", "answer": "Ray Birdwhistell understood body movements to be culturally patterned rather than universal."}, {"question": "What was required of Ray Birdwhistell's students?", "answer": "Ray Birdwhistell's students were required to read widely, sources not only in communication but also anthropology and linguistics."}, {"question": "Who had a huge influence on Ray Birdwhistell's work?", "answer": "Collaborations with others, including initially Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, and later, Erving Goffman and Dell Hymes had huge influence on Ray Birdwhistell's work."}, {"question": "What book is Ray Birdwhistell best known for?", "answer": "Ray Birdwhistell is best known for the book 'Kinesics and Context'."}, {"question": "Who envisioned the book 'Kinesics and Context'?", "answer": "The book 'Kinesics and Context' would not have appeared if it had not been envisaged by Erving Goffman."}, {"question": "What tradition had a direct influence on Ray Birdwhistell's work?", "answer": "The tradition most directly represented at the University of Pennsylvania by Hymes had a direct influence on Ray Birdwhistell's work, which he explicitly stated as 'anthropological linguistics'."}]}

{"title": "Imhoff tank", "passage": "The Imhoff tank, named for German engineer Karl Imhoff (1876–1965), is a chamber suitable for the reception and processing of sewage.  It may be used for the clarification of sewage by simple settling and sedimentation, along with anaerobic digestion of the extracted sludge.  It consists of an upper chamber in which sedimentation takes place, from which collected solids slide down inclined bottom slopes to an entrance into a lower chamber in which the sludge is collected and digested.  The two chambers are otherwise unconnected, with sewage flowing only through the upper sedimentation chamber and no flow of sewage in the lower digestion chamber.  The lower chamber requires separate biogas vents and pipes for the removal of digested sludge, typically after 6-9 months of digestion.  The Imhoff tank is in effect a two-story septic tank and retains the septic tank's simplicity while eliminating many of its drawbacks, which largely result from the mixing of fresh sewage and septic sludge in the same chamber.", "qa": [{"question": "Who is the Imhoff tank named after?", "answer": "The Imhoff tank is named after German engineer Karl Imhoff."}, {"question": "What is the Imhoff tank used for?", "answer": "The Imhoff tank is used for the reception and processing of sewage."}, {"question": "What process occurs in the upper chamber of the Imhoff tank?", "answer": "Sedimentation takes place in the upper chamber of the Imhoff tank."}, {"question": "How do solids move from the upper chamber to the lower chamber in the Imhoff tank?", "answer": "Collected solids slide down inclined bottom slopes to an entrance into a lower chamber in the Imhoff tank."}, {"question": "What happens to the sludge in the lower chamber of the Imhoff tank?", "answer": "The sludge is collected and digested in the lower chamber of the Imhoff tank."}, {"question": "How long does it take for the sludge to be digested in the Imhoff tank?", "answer": "The sludge is typically digested for 6-9 months in the Imhoff tank."}, {"question": "What is the Imhoff tank in effect?", "answer": "The Imhoff tank is in effect a two-story septic tank."}, {"question": "What are the advantages of the Imhoff tank compared to a septic tank?", "answer": "The Imhoff tank eliminates many of the drawbacks of septic tanks, which largely result from the mixing of fresh sewage and septic sludge in the same chamber."}]}
