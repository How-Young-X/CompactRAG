None of them ever had a music lesson yet excelled on every instrument they touched.  Natives of the Gilbert Creek region of southern West Virginia, Cousin Ezra, along with brothers Ireland (Lazy Ned) and Curly Ray Cline, were part of the original Lonesome Pine Fiddlers from about 1938, a group that worked on radio at WHIS Bluefield, West Virginia.  During World War II, Ned was killed in action.  When the Pine Fiddlers resumed regular daily broadcasts, Charlie, who played multiple instruments, joined them on a regular basis.  Charlie returned to the Fiddlers briefly before becoming a member of Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys.  During 1952-1955, Charlie worked off and on with Monroe, recording some 38 songs, all on Decca.  It has been said that he played every instrument at one time or another in the Monroe group except mandolin.  Charlie spent most of 1953 back with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers working at WJR radio in Detroit.  When Ezra brought the band to Pikeville, Kentucky, in November, Charlie rejoined Bill Monroe.  In 1954, Charlie did a session, playing lead guitar, with the Stanley Brothers and also another one on RCA with the Fiddlers, although he was not otherwise working with them at the time.  He also worked briefly as a sideman with the Osborne Brothers, although he did not record with them.  By 1958, Charlie (electric lead guitar) and his wife, Lee (electric bass), had rejoined Ezra and Curly Ray in the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, who were experimenting with a more modern sound and working a TV show in Huntington, West Virginia, in addition to daily radio in Pikeville.  In his later years, Charlie was with the Stanley Brothers.  Curly Ray also played with the Stanley Brothers at a different time as their fiddler.  Curly Ray was one of the best fiddlers in Bluegrass.  This most talented family of musicians were the best, surpassed by none.  Finally, on October 1, 2009, The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers got their due when they were inducted into the International Bluegrass Hall of Fame at the Ryman Theater (the original home of the Grand Ole Opry).  Bobby Osborne, Melvin Goins and Paul Williams were there to receive the bands award.  In the crowd of a sold out theater was the son of Ezra Cline, Scotty Ireland Cline, who recalled being in that same theater as a child sitting on stage and watching the Fiddlers play.  (At the time, the Opry had bleachers for family just off stage).  The final act of the evening at the IBMA Awards was the playing of \"Pain in my Heart\" by Osborne, Goins and Williams along with a Song from the Dillards, who were also inducted the same evening.", "reason": "no_valid_qa_generated", "qa_list": [], "input_tokens": 2299, "output_tokens": 1128, "total_tokens": 3427, "validation_info": {"invalid_questions": [], "missing_phrases": ["The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers", "Ezra Cline", "Bobby Osborne", "Paul Williams", "Melvin Goins", "Charlie Cline", "Curly Ray Cline", "Jimmy Martin", "Cousin Ezra and the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers", "Gilbert Creek", "West Virginia", "WHIS Bluefield", "Bill Monroe", "Lester Flatt", "Earl Scruggs", "Hank Williams", "Blue Grass Boys", "Decca", "WJR radio", "Pikeville", "Kentucky", "Stanley Brothers", "RCA", "Osborne Brothers", "Huntington", "Ryman Theater", "Grand Ole Opry", "International Bluegrass Hall of Fame", "Scotty Ireland Cline", "Dillards", "Pain in my Heart"], "required_phrases": ["The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers", "Ezra Cline", "Bobby Osborne", "Paul Williams", "Melvin Goins", "Charlie Cline", "Curly Ray Cline", "Jimmy Martin", "Cousin Ezra and the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers", "Gilbert Creek", "West Virginia", "WHIS Bluefield", "Bill Monroe", "Lester Flatt", "Earl Scruggs", "Hank Williams", "Blue Grass Boys", "Decca", "WJR radio", "Pikeville", "Kentucky", "Stanley Brothers", "RCA", "Osborne Brothers", "Huntington", "Ryman Theater", "Grand Ole Opry", "International Bluegrass Hall of Fame", "Scotty Ireland Cline", "Dillards", "Pain in my Heart"]}}

Sikh History is around 500 years and in that time the Sikhs have developed unique expressions of art and culture which are influenced by their faith and synthesize traditions from many other cultures.  Sikhism is Punjab's only indigenous religion with all other religions coming from outside Punjab (with the possible exception of Punjabi Hinduism since the oldest Hindu scripture – the Rig Veda – was composed in the Punjab region.

Punjabi culture and Sikhism are considered inseparably intertwined.  \"Sikh\" properly refers to adherents of Sikhism as a religion, not an ethnic group.

Many countries, such as the U.K., therefore recognize Sikh as a designated ethnicity on their censuses.
