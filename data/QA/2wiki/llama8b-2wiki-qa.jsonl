He declared himself as an opponent to the president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and a candidate to his succession. Mekki was one of the few political opponents calling for an immediate end to the Ben Ali regime, and his prosecution for corruption and torture. Mekki was born in Tunis. he embraced many of Tunisia's first president Habib Bourguiba's foreign policies which called for a pragmatic solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and closer ties with Western countries. He presented himself as moderate and quickly distanced himself from other political opponents including Islamists. After 12 June 2007, Mekki posted his speeches online revealing the foundation of his presidential programme. He called for the birth of a \"Second Tunisian republic\" where rights would be guaranteed to all Tunisians. According to him, this was the only alternative to the then existing regime. Mekki claimed that women had been wearing veils as a mean of silent political protests rather than true religious conviction. Mekki proposed to fight the \"real\" roots of Islamic Terrorism and blamed President Ben Ali's policies for the rise of extremists. This could also just have been a ploy to gain support in the West, as Ben Ali had similarly proclaimed to be fighting terrorism. Mekki's team produced a series of political comic sketches called \"Mille et une nuits\" (engl. \" One Thousand and One Nights or Elf Leila w Leila\") in which he ridiculed President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, his wife Leila Trabelsi-Ben Ali, and the Trabelsi family – the name of the sketches themselves a jab at the president's wife.

{"title": "International relations theory", "passage": "International relations theory is the study of international relations( IR) from a theoretical perspective. It attempts to provide a conceptual framework upon which international relations can be analyzed. Ole Holsti describes international relations theories as acting like pairs of coloured sunglasses that allow the wearer to see only salient events relevant to the theory; e.g., an adherent of realism may completely disregard an event that a constructivist might pounce upon as crucial, and vice versa. The three most prominent theories are realism, liberalism and constructivism. Sometimes, institutionalism proposed and developed by Keohane and Nye is discussed as a paradigm differed from liberalism. International relations theories can be divided into\" positivist/ rationalist\" theories which focus on a principally state- level analysis, and\" post-positivist/ reflectivist\" ones which incorporate expanded meanings of security, ranging from class, to gender, to postcolonial security. Many often conflicting ways of thinking exist in IR theory, including constructivism, institutionalism, Marxism, neo- Gramscianism, and others. However, two positivist schools of thought are most prevalent: realism and liberalism. The study of international relations, as theory, can be traced to E. H. Carr's\" The Twenty Years' Crisis\", which was published in 1939, and to Hans Morgenthau's\" Politics Among Nations\" published in 1948. International relations, as a discipline, is believed to have emerged after the First World War with the establishment of a Chair of International Relations at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. Early international relations scholarship in the interwar years focused on the need for the balance of power system to be replaced with a system of collective security. These thinkers were later described as\" Idealists\". The leading critique of this school of thinking was the\" realist\" analysis offered by Carr. However, a more recent study, by David Long and Brian Schmidt in 2005, offers a revisionist account of the origins of the field of international relations. They claim that the history of the field can be traced back to late 19th Century imperialism and internationalism. The fact that the history of the field is presented by\" great debates\", such as the realist- idealist debate, does not correspond with the historic evidence found in earlier works: \" We should once and for all dispense with the outdated anachronistic artifice of the debate between the idealists and realists as the dominant framework for and understanding the history of the field\". Their revisionist account claims that, up until 1918, international relations already existed in the form of colonial administration, race science, and race development.

{"title": "The General Line", "passage": "The General Line, also known as Old and New , is a 1929 Soviet drama film directed by Sergei Eisenstein and Grigori Aleksandrov. \"The General Line\" was begun in 1927 as a celebration of the collectivization of agriculture, as championed by old-line Bolshevik Leon Trotsky. Hoping to reach a wide audience, the director forsook his usual practice of emphasizing groups by concentrating on a single rural heroine. Eisenstein briefly abandoned this project to film , in honour of the 10th anniversary of the Revolution. By the time he was able to return to this film, the Party's attitudes had changed and Trotsky had fallen from grace.

With her husband, she reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of Ancient Egyptian history. Some scholars believe that Nefertiti ruled briefly as Neferneferuaten after her husband's death and before the accession of Tutankhamun, although this identification is a matter of ongoing debate. If Nefertiti did rule as Pharaoh, her reign was marked by the fall of Amarna and relocation of the capital back to the traditional city of Thebes. Nefertiti had many titles including Hereditary Princess (iryt-p`t); Great of Praises (wrt-Hzwt); Lady of Grace (nbt-im3t), Sweet of Love (bnrt-mrwt); Lady of The Two Lands (nbt-t3wy); Main King's Wife, his beloved (Hmt-nswt-‘3t mryt.f); Great King's Wife, his beloved (Hmt-nswt-wrt mryt.f), Lady of All Women (Hnwt-Hmwt-nbwt); and Mistress of Upper and Lower Egypt (Hnwt-Shm’w-mhw).

{"title": "Place of birth", "passage": "The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.", "qa": [{"question": "What is the place of birth?", "answer": "The place of birth is the place where a person was born."}, {"question": "Why is the place of birth important?", "answer": "The place of birth is important because it is often used in legal documents to uniquely identify a person."}, {"question": "How is the place of birth determined?", "answer": "The place of birth is determined by the country that currently has sovereignty over the actual place of birth."}, {"question": "What is the difference between place of birth and place of origin?", "answer": "The place of birth is the actual location where a person was born, while the place of origin is the location where a person's parents or ancestors came from."}, {"question": "What is jus soli?", "answer": "Jus soli is a practice where the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby."}, {"question": "What is jus sanguinis?", "answer": "Jus sanguinis is a practice where nationality is attributed based on the nationality of the baby's parents."}, {"question": "What happens if a baby is born on an airplane or at sea?", "answer": "The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved."}, {"question": "What is the difference between place of birth and nationality at birth?", "answer": "The place of birth is the location where a person was born, while nationality at birth refers to the country of which a person is a citizen at the time of birth."}, {"question": "How do countries determine the nationality of a child born abroad?", "answer": "Countries determine the nationality of a child born abroad based on the nationality of the parents or the location of the birth."}, {"question": "What is the concept of domicile of birth?", "answer": "The concept of domicile of birth is used in some countries, such as Sweden, where the domicile of the baby's mother is considered the registered place of birth."}, {"question": "What is the concept of Heimatort?", "answer": "The concept of Heimatort is used in Switzerland, where a child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name."}]}

{"title": "Ankhesenamun", "passage": "Ankhesenamun (\"Her Life Is of Amun\"; c. 1348 – after 1322 BC) was a queen of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. Born Ankhesenpaaten, she was the third of six known daughters of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten and his Great Royal Wife Nefertiti, and became the Great Royal Wife of her half-brother Tutankhamun. The change in her name reflects the changes in Ancient Egyptian religion during her lifetime after her father's death. Her youth is well documented in the ancient reliefs and paintings of the reign of her parents. Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun shared the same father but Tutankhamun's mother has recently been established by genetic evidence as one of Akhenaten's sisters, a daughter (so far unidentified) of Amenhotep III. Ankhesenamun was definitely married to one king; she was the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Tutankhamun. It is also possible that she was briefly married to Tutankhamun's successor, Ay, believed by some to be her maternal grandfather.

{"title": "Phintys", "passage": "Phintys was a Pythagorean philosopher, probably from the third century BC. She wrote a work on the correct behaviour of women, two extracts of which are preserved by Stobaeus. According to Stobaeus, Phintys was the daughter of Callicrates, who is otherwise unknown. Holger Thesleff suggests that this Callicrates might be identified with Callicratidas, a Spartan general who died at the Battle of Arginusae. If so, this would make Phintys a Spartan, and date her birth to the late fifth century BC, and her floruit to the fourth century. I. M. Plant considers this emendation \"fanciful\". Iamblichus mentions Philtys in his list of female Pythagoreans; he says that she was from Croton and that her father was called Theophrius. I. M. Plant believes that Iamblichus' Philtys, though also a Pythagorean and similarly named, is distinct from Stobaeus' Phintys. Two fragments attributed to Phintys are preserved in Stobaeus. However, not all scholars agree that the fragments are authentic: Lefkowitz and Fant argue that the works attributed to female Pythagoreans, including Phintys, were actually rhetorical exercises written by men. They are written in the Doric dialect, and amount to about 80 lines of prose. The language used dates to around the fourth century BC, although some features of it appear to be deliberate archaisms; it was likely actually composed in the third century BC, though a date as late as the second century AD was suggested by Friedrich Wilhelm in 1915.

After embarking on an acting career in 1950 when she was 20, Kelly appeared in New York City theatrical productions and more than 40 episodes of live drama productions broadcast during the early 1950s Golden Age of Television. From 1952 to 1956 she starred in several critically and commercially successful films, usually opposite male romantic leads 25 to 30 years older than her. In October 1953, she gained stardom from her performance in director John Ford's African-filmed adventure-romance \"Mogambo\", starring Clark Gable and Ava Gardner, which won her a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In 1954 she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her deglamorized performance in the drama \"The Country Girl\" with Bing Crosby. Other noteworthy films in which she starred include the western \"High Noon\" (1952), with Gary Cooper; the romance-comedy musical \"High Society\" (1956), with Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra; and three Alfred Hitchcock suspense thrillers in rapid succession: \"Dial M for Murder\" (1954), with Ray Milland; \"Rear Window\" (1954), with James Stewart; and \"To Catch a Thief\" (1955), with Cary Grant. Kelly retired from acting at the age of 26 to marry Rainier, and began her duties as Princess of Monaco. It is well known that Hitchcock was hoping she would appear in more of his films which required an \"icy blonde\" lead actress, but he was unable to coax her out of retirement.

This was followed by a string of attacks against Western targets. For many years he was among the most-wanted international fugitives. Carlos was dubbed \"The Jackal\" by \"The Guardian\" after one of its correspondents reportedly spotted Frederick Forsyth's 1971 novel \"The Day of the Jackal\" near some of the fugitive's belongings. For his part, Ramírez Sánchez denied the 1975 French killings, saying they were orchestrated by Mossad, the Israeli secret service, and condemned Israel as a terrorist state. During his trial in France in 1997, he said, \"When one wages war for 30 years, there is a lot of blood spilled—mine and others. But we never killed anyone for money, but for a cause—the liberation of Palestine. \" In 2017 he claimed responsibility for a total of 80 deaths, and boasted that \"no one in the Palestinian resistance has executed more people than I have.\"", "qa": [{"question": "Who is Carlos the Jackal?", "answer": "Carlos the Jackal is Ilich Ramírez Sánchez."}, {"question": "When was Carlos the Jackal born?", "answer": "Carlos the Jackal was born on 12 October 1949."}, {"question": "What is Carlos the Jackal's nationality?", "answer": "Carlos the Jackal is a native Venezuelan."}, {"question": "What is Carlos the Jackal's current status?", "answer": "Carlos the Jackal is currently serving a life sentence in France."}, {"question": "What is Carlos the Jackal's political ideology?", "answer": "Carlos the Jackal is a committed Marxist–Leninist."}, {"question": "What is the name of the organization Carlos the Jackal joined in 1970?", "answer": "Carlos the Jackal joined the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in 1970."}, {"question": "What is the code name given to Carlos the Jackal by Bassam Abu Sharif?", "answer": "Bassam Abu Sharif gave Carlos the Jackal the code name 'Carlos' because of his South American roots."}, {"question": "What was the name of the novel that inspired the nickname 'The Jackal'?", "answer": "The novel that inspired the nickname 'The Jackal' is 'The Day of the Jackal' by Frederick Forsyth."}, {"question": "What is Carlos the Jackal's stance on the 1975 French killings?", "answer": "Carlos the Jackal denied the 1975 French killings, saying they were orchestrated by Mossad, the Israeli secret service."}, {"question": "How many deaths did Carlos the Jackal claim responsibility for?", "answer": "Carlos the Jackal claimed responsibility for a total of 80 deaths."}, {"question": "What is Carlos the Jackal's motivation for his actions?", "answer": "Carlos the Jackal said he killed for a cause—the liberation of Palestine."}, {"question": "What is the name of the trial Carlos the Jackal was involved in?", "answer": "Carlos the Jackal was involved in his trial in France in 1997."}]}

She married Henry in 1485 after his victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field, which marked the end of the Wars of the Roses. Together, Elizabeth and Henry had seven, possibly eight, children. After the death of her father, King Edward IV, Elizabeth's brothers the \"Princes in the Tower\" disappeared, their fate uncertain. Although the 1484 act of Parliament \"Titulus Regius\" declared the marriage of her parents, Edward and Elizabeth Woodville, invalid, she and her sisters were subsequently welcomed back to court by Edward's brother, King Richard III. As a Yorkist princess, the final victory of the Lancastrian faction in the War of the Roses may have seemed a further disaster, but Henry Tudor knew the importance of Yorkist support for his invasion and promised to marry Elizabeth before he arrived in England. This may well have contributed to the hemorrhaging of Yorkist support for Richard. Although Elizabeth seems to have played little part in politics, her marriage appears to have been a successful one. Her eldest son Arthur, Prince of Wales, died at age 15 in 1502, and three other children died young. Her second, and only surviving, son became King Henry VIII of England, while her daughters Mary and Margaret became queen of France and queen of Scotland, respectively; many modern royals, including Elizabeth II, trace their line through Margaret.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was the first queen consort of England of the Tudor dynasty?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York was the first queen consort of England of the Tudor dynasty."}, {"question": "When did Elizabeth of York become the queen consort of England?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York became the queen consort of England on 18 January 1486."}, {"question": "Who did Elizabeth of York marry?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York married Henry VII."}, {"question": "What was the outcome of the Battle of Bosworth Field?", "answer": "The Battle of Bosworth Field marked the end of the Wars of the Roses and led to Henry VII's victory."}, {"question": "How many children did Elizabeth of York and Henry VII have?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York and Henry VII had seven, possibly eight, children."}, {"question": "What happened to Elizabeth of York's brothers, the 'Princes in the Tower'?", "answer": "The fate of Elizabeth of York's brothers, the 'Princes in the Tower', is uncertain."}, {"question": "Why did Henry Tudor promise to marry Elizabeth of York?", "answer": "Henry Tudor promised to marry Elizabeth of York to gain Yorkist support for his invasion."}, {"question": "What was the outcome of Elizabeth of York's marriage to Henry VII?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York's marriage to Henry VII appears to have been a successful one."}, {"question": "What happened to Elizabeth of York's eldest son, Arthur, Prince of Wales?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York's eldest son, Arthur, Prince of Wales, died at age 15 in 1502."}, {"question": "Who became King Henry VIII of England?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York's second, and only surviving, son became King Henry VIII of England."}, {"question": "What happened to Elizabeth of York's daughters, Mary and Margaret?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York's daughters, Mary and Margaret, became queen of France and queen of Scotland, respectively."}]}

{"title": "Charles VII of France", "passage": "Charles VII (22 February 1403 – 22 July 1461), called the Victorious  or the Well-Served , was King of France from 1422 to his death in 1461. In the midst of the Hundred Years' War, Charles VII inherited the throne of France under desperate circumstances. Forces of the Kingdom of England and the Duke of Burgundy occupied Guyenne and northern France, including Paris, the most populous city, and Reims, the city in which the French kings were traditionally crowned. In addition, his father Charles VI had disinherited him in 1420 and recognized Henry V of England and his heirs as the legitimate successors to the French crown instead. At the same time, a civil war raged in France between the Armagnacs (supporters of the House of Valois) and the Burgundian party (supporters of the House of Valois-Burgundy allied to the English). With his court removed to Bourges, south of the Loire River, Charles was disparagingly called the “King of Bourges”, because the area around this city was one of the few remaining regions left to him. However, his political and military position improved dramatically with the emergence of Joan of Arc as a spiritual leader in France. Joan of Arc and other charismatic figures led French troops to lift the siege of Orléans, as well as other strategic cities on the Loire river, and to crush the English at the battle of Patay. With the local English troops dispersed, the people of Reims switched allegiance and opened their gates, which enabled the coronation of Charles VII in 1429 at Reims Cathedral. A few years later he ended the English-Burgundian alliance by signing the Treaty of Arras in 1435, followed by the recovery of Paris in 1436 and the steady reconquest of Normandy in the 1440s using a newly organized professional army and advanced siege cannons. Following the battle of Castillon in 1453, the French expelled the English from all their continental possessions except for the Pale of Calais. The last years of Charles VII were marked by conflicts with his turbulent son, the future Louis XI of France.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was the King of France from 1422 to 1461?", "answer": "Charles VII was the King of France from 1422 to 1461."}, {"question": "What was Charles VII's nickname?", "answer": "Charles VII was nicknamed the Victorious or the Well-Served."}, {"question": "Why was Charles VII's position desperate when he inherited the throne?", "answer": "Charles VII's position was desperate when he inherited the throne because forces of the Kingdom of England and the Duke of Burgundy occupied Guyenne and northern France."}, {"question": "What was the name of the city where the French kings were traditionally crowned?", "answer": "The city where the French kings were traditionally crowned was Reims."}, {"question": "What was the name of the river where Charles VII's court was removed?", "answer": "The name of the river where Charles VII's court was removed was the Loire River."}, {"question": "Who led French troops to lift the siege of Orléans and crush the English at the battle of Patay?", "answer": "Joan of Arc and other charismatic figures led French troops to lift the siege of Orléans and crush the English at the battle of Patay."}, {"question": "Where was Charles VII coronated in 1429?", "answer": "Charles VII was coronated in 1429 at Reims Cathedral."}, {"question": "What was the name of the treaty signed by Charles VII in 1435?", "answer": "The name of the treaty signed by Charles VII in 1435 was the Treaty of Arras."}, {"question": "What was the name of the battle in which the French expelled the English from all their continental possessions except for the Pale of Calais?", "answer": "The name of the battle in which the French expelled the English from all their continental possessions except for the Pale of Calais was the battle of Castillon."}, {"question": "Who was Charles VII's son who was involved in conflicts with him in the last years of his reign?", "answer": "Charles VII's son who was involved in conflicts with him in the last years of his reign was the future Louis XI of France."}]}

{"title": "Selena", "passage": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez (April 16, 1971 – March 31, 1995) was an American singer, songwriter, spokesperson, model, actress, and fashion designer. Called the Queen of Tejano music, her contributions to music and fashion made her one of the most celebrated Mexican-American entertainers of the late 20th century. \"Billboard\" magazine named her the top-selling Latin artist of the 1990s decade, while her posthumous collaboration with MAC cosmetics became the best-selling celebrity collection in cosmetics history. Media outlets called her the \"Tejano Madonna\" for her clothing choices. She also ranks among the most influential Latin artists of all time and is credited for catapulting a music genre into the mainstream market. The youngest child of the Quintanilla family, she debuted on the music scene in 1980 as a member of the band Selena y Los Dinos, which also included her elder siblings A.B. Quintanilla and Suzette Quintanilla. She began recording professionally in 1982. In the 1980s, she was often criticized and was refused bookings at venues across Texas for performing Tejano music—a male-dominated music genre. However, her popularity grew after she won the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year in 1987, which she won nine consecutive times. She signed with EMI Latin in 1989 and released her self-titled debut album the same year, while her brother became her principal music producer and songwriter. Selena released \"Entre a Mi Mundo\" (1992), which peaked at number one on the US \"Billboard\" Regional Mexican Albums chart for eight consecutive months. The album's commercial success led music critics to call it the \"breakthrough\" recording of her musical career. One of its singles, \"Como la Flor\", became one of her most popular signature songs. \"Live!\" (1993) won Best Mexican/American Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards, becoming the first recording by a female Tejano artist to do so. In 1994, she released \"Amor Prohibido\", which became one of the best-selling Latin albums in the United States. It was critically acclaimed as being responsible for Tejano music's first marketable era as it became one of the most popular Latin music subgenres at the time. Selena and her guitarist, Chris Pérez, eloped in April 1992 after her father raised concerns over their relationship. On March 31, 1995, she was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldívar, her friend and former manager of her Selena Etc. boutiques. Saldívar was cornered by police when she attempted to flee, and threatened to kill herself, but was convinced to give herself up and was sentenced to life in prison with possible parole after 30 years. Two weeks later, future US President George W. Bush—governor of Texas at the time—declared Selena's birthday Selena Day in Texas. Her posthumous crossover album, \"Dreaming of You\" (1995), debuted atop the \"Billboard\" 200, making Selena the first Latin artist to do this feat. In 1997, Warner Bros. released \"Selena\", a film about her life and career, which starred Jennifer Lopez as Selena and Lupe Ontiveros as Saldívar. , Selena has sold 60-65 million albums worldwide, making her one of the best-selling female artist in Latin music history.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was Selena Quintanilla-Pérez?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was an American singer, songwriter, spokesperson, model, actress, and fashion designer."}, {"question": "When was Selena Quintanilla-Pérez born?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was born on April 16, 1971."}, {"question": "When did Selena Quintanilla-Pérez die?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez died on March 31, 1995."}, {"question": "What was Selena Quintanilla-Pérez's nickname?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was called the Queen of Tejano music."}, {"question": "What was the name of Selena Quintanilla-Pérez's debut album?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez's debut album was self-titled, released in 1989."}, {"question": "What was the name of Selena Quintanilla-Pérez's brother who became her principal music producer and songwriter?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez's brother who became her principal music producer and songwriter was A.B.

{"title": "Muhammad Ali Jinnah", "passage": "Muhammad Ali Jinnah (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a lawyer, politician and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until Pakistan's creation on 14 August 1947, and then as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death. He is revered in Pakistan as \"Quaid-i-AzamGreat Leader\") and \"Baba-i-QaumFather of the Nation\"). His birthday is considered a national holiday in Pakistan. Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his return to British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of \"satyagraha\", which he regarded as political anarchy. By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that Muslims of the Indian subcontinent should have their own state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation. During the Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula for the subcontinent to be united as a single state, leading all parties to agree to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan. As the first Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from the new nation of India to Pakistan after independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan.

{"title": "Francis I Rákóczi", "passage": "Francis I Rákóczi (February 24, 1645, Gyulafehérvár, Transylvania – July 8, 1676, Zboró, Royal Hungary) was a Hungarian aristocrat, elected prince of Transylvania and father of Hungarian national hero Francis Rákóczi II. Francis Rákóczi was the son of George Rákóczi II, prince of Transylvania, and Sophia Báthory. He was elected prince by the Transylvanian Diet in 1652, during his father's life. However, because of the disastrous Polish campaign of 1657 and its consequences, the Ottoman Empire removed his father from the throne in 1660, and prohibited any Rákóczi to ascend the Transylvanian throne. This left Francis unable to come by his father's legacy; he therefore withdrew to his estates in Royal Hungary. Notably, the Rákóczi family was Calvinist, and they were staunch supporters of the Reformed Church in Hungary. However, Francis' mother, Sophia Báthory, had converted to Calvinism merely for the sake of her marriage. After her husband's death, she returned to Catholicism and supported the Counter Reformation. Francis Rákóczi also became a Catholic, thus acquiring favour with the Catholic Habsburg Court. His mother converted him to Catholicism. He was made a count in 1664. In 1666 Francis married Jelena Zrinska (Hungarian: Zrínyi Ilona), a Croatian countess, and joined the Wesselényi conspiracy (\"Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy\" in Croatia), one leader of which was Jelena's father, Petar Zrinski (Hungarian: Zrínyi Péter). Francis soon became the leader of the conspiracy, and, as a culmination of their anti-Habsburg stratagems, started an armed uprising of nobles in Upper Hungary, while the other conspirators were supposed to start the fight in Croatia. Due to poor organization and discord between the conspirators, however, the Austrian authorities were well informed; they quickly suppressed the Croatian branch of the revolt. When Rákóczi learned that Petar Zrinski had been captured by the Austrians, he laid down his arms and applied for mercy. All other leaders of the conspiracy were executed for high treason; Rákóczi, due to his mother's intervention, and for a ransom of 300,000 forints and several castles, was pardoned.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was Francis I Rákóczi?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi was a Hungarian aristocrat."}, {"question": "When was Francis I Rákóczi born?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi was born on February 24, 1645."}, {"question": "Where was Francis I Rákóczi born?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi was born in Gyulafehérvár, Transylvania."}, {"question": "Who was Francis I Rákóczi's father?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi's father was George Rákóczi II, prince of Transylvania."}, {"question": "Who was Francis I Rákóczi's mother?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi's mother was Sophia Báthory."}, {"question": "Why was Francis I Rákóczi unable to come by his father's legacy?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi was unable to come by his father's legacy because of the disastrous Polish campaign of 1657 and its consequences."}, {"question": "What was the Rákóczi family's religious affiliation?", "answer": "The Rákóczi family was Calvinist."}, {"question": "What was Francis I Rákóczi's mother's religious affiliation before her marriage?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi's mother, Sophia Báthory, was a Calvinist before her marriage."}, {"question": "What was Francis I Rákóczi's mother's religious affiliation after her husband's death?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi's mother, Sophia Báthory, returned to Catholicism after her husband's death."}, {"question": "What was Francis I Rákóczi's title in 1664?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi was made a count in 1664."}, {"question": "Who did Francis I Rákóczi marry in 1666?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi married Jelena Zrinska, a Croatian countess, in 1666."}, {"question": "What was the name of the conspiracy that Francis I Rákóczi joined?", "answer": "The name of the conspiracy that Francis I Rákóczi joined was the Wesselényi conspiracy."}, {"question": "What was the outcome of the armed uprising of nobles in Upper Hungary led by Francis I Rákóczi?", "answer": "The armed uprising of nobles in Upper Hungary led by Francis I Rákóczi was quickly suppressed by the Austrian authorities."}, {"question": "What was the outcome of the Croatian branch of the revolt led by Petar Zrinski?", "answer": "The Croatian branch of the revolt led by Petar Zrinski was also quickly suppressed by the Austrian authorities."}, {"question": "Why did Francis I Rákóczi lay down his arms?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi laid down his arms when he learned that Petar Zrinski had been captured by the Austrians."}, {"question": "What was the ransom paid by Francis I Rákóczi for his pardon?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi paid a ransom of 300,000 forints and several castles for his pardon."}]}

He was a son of Emperor Iyasu I and brother to Emperors Tekle Haymanot I and Dawit III. James Bruce describes Bakaffa as faced with the increasing enfeeblement of the Ethiopian Empire as well as growing intrigue and conspiracies. To respond to these challenges, writes Bruce, Bakaffa was \"silent, secret, and unfathomable in his designs, surrounded by soldiers who were his own slaves, and by new men of his own creation. \" In writing his account of this Emperor's reign, Bruce claims that at the time of his writing no \"Royal Chronicle\" of his reign existed, because it \"would have been a very dangerous book to have been kept in Bacuffa's time; and, accordingly, no person chose ever to run that risk; and the king's particular behaviour afterwards had still the further effect, that nobody would supply this deficiency after his death, a general belief prevailing in Abyssinia that he is alive to this day, and will appear again in all his terrors. \" As a result, Bruce's account of Bakaffa's reign consists of a collection of impressionistic vignettes of selected events—his travels through Ethiopia in disguise, his feigned death, his first meetings with people who were to play an important role during his rule—which support this portrait. In contrast, the editor of the 1805 edition of Bruce's work, Alexander Murray, excised all but the first two paragraphs of his chapter on this ruler, replacing Bruce's material with a summary of a chronicle of the reign, stating that \"the annals of this period are very complete, the public transactions of Bacuffa are well known, though his motives seldom escaped from his own impenetrable breast.\"", "qa": [{"question": "Who was the Emperor of Ethiopia from May 18, 1721, to September 19, 1730?", "answer": "Bakaffa was the Emperor of Ethiopia from May 18, 1721, to September 19, 1730."}, {"question": "What was the throne name of Bakaffa?", "answer": "The throne name of Bakaffa was Aṣma Giyorgis, later Masih Sagad."}, {"question": "Who were the parents of Bakaffa?", "answer": "Bakaffa was a son of Emperor Iyasu I and a member of the Solomonic dynasty."}, {"question": "Who were the brothers of Bakaffa?", "answer": "Bakaffa was a brother to Emperors Tekle Haymanot I and Dawit III."}, {"question": "What challenges did Bakaffa face during his reign?", "answer": "Bakaffa faced the increasing enfeeblement of the Ethiopian Empire as well as growing intrigue and conspiracies."}, {"question": "How did Bakaffa respond to these challenges?", "answer": "Bakaffa was 'silent, secret, and unfathomable in his designs, surrounded by soldiers who were his own slaves, and by new men of his own creation.'"}, {"question": "Why did no 'Royal Chronicle' of Bakaffa's reign exist?", "answer": "According to James Bruce, it 'would have been a very dangerous book to have been kept in Bacuffa's time; and, accordingly, no person chose ever to run that risk.'"}, {"question": "What is the current general belief about Bakaffa's fate?", "answer": "A general belief prevailing in Abyssinia is that Bakaffa is alive to this day, and will appear again in all his terrors."}, {"question": "Who edited the 1805 edition of James Bruce's work?", "answer": "Alexander Murray edited the 1805 edition of James Bruce's work."}, {"question": "What did Alexander Murray do to Bruce's chapter on Bakaffa?", "answer": "Alexander Murray excised all but the first two paragraphs of Bruce's chapter on Bakaffa, replacing it with a summary of a chronicle of the reign."}]}

He was succeeded by his son, Augustus III of Poland. Augustus' great physical strength earned him the nicknames \"the Strongthe Saxon Hercules\" and \"Iron-Hand\". He liked to show that he lived up to his name by breaking horseshoes with his bare hands and engaging in fox tossing by holding the end of his sling with just one finger while two of the strongest men in his court held the other end. He is also notable for fathering a very large number of children. In order to be elected King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Augustus converted to Roman Catholicism. As a Catholic, he received the Order of the Golden Fleece from the Holy Roman Emperor. As Elector of Saxony, he is perhaps best remembered as a patron of the arts and architecture. He established the Saxon capital of Dresden as a major cultural centre, attracting artists from across Europe to his court. Augustus also amassed an impressive art collection and built lavish baroque palaces in Dresden and Warsaw. His reigns brought Poland some troubled times. He led the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the Great Northern War, which allowed the Russian Empire to strengthen its influence in Europe, especially within Poland. His main pursuit was bolstering royal power in the Commonwealth, characterized by broad decentralization in comparison with other European monarchies. He tried to accomplish this goal using foreign powers and thus destabilized the state. Augustus ruled Poland with an interval; in 1704 the Swedes installed nobleman Stanisław Leszczyński as king, who officially reigned from 1706 to 1709 and after Augustus' death in 1733 which sparked the War of the Polish Succession. He was buried in Poland's royal Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, but his heart rests in the Dresden Cathedral.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was Augustus II the Strong?", "answer": "Augustus II the Strong was Augustus II the Strong."}, {"question": "When was Augustus II the Strong born?", "answer": "Augustus II the Strong was born on 12 May 1670."}, {"question": "When did Augustus II the Strong die?", "answer": "Augustus II the Strong died on 1 February 1733."}, {"question": "What were the nicknames of Augustus II the Strong?", "answer": "The nicknames of Augustus II the Strong were 'the Strong', 'the Saxon Hercules', and 'Iron-Hand'."}, {"question": "What was the physical strength of Augustus II the Strong?", "answer": "Augustus II the Strong had great physical strength."}, {"question": "What were the hobbies of Augustus II the Strong?", "answer": "The hobbies of Augustus II the Strong included breaking horseshoes with his bare hands and engaging in fox tossing."}, {"question": "How many children did Augustus II the Strong have?", "answer": "Augustus II the Strong fathered a very large number of children."}, {"question": "Why did Augustus II the Strong convert to Roman Catholicism?", "answer": "Augustus II the Strong converted to Roman Catholicism in order to be elected King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth."}, {"question": "What was the Order of the Golden Fleece given to Augustus II the Strong for?", "answer": "The Order of the Golden Fleece was given to Augustus II the Strong as a Catholic."}, {"question": "What was the role of Augustus II the Strong as Elector of Saxony?", "answer": "As Elector of Saxony, Augustus II the Strong is perhaps best remembered as a patron of the arts and architecture."}, {"question": "What did Augustus II the Strong establish in Dresden?", "answer": "Augustus II the Strong established the Saxon capital of Dresden as a major cultural centre."}, {"question": "What did Augustus II the Strong build in Dresden and Warsaw?", "answer": "Augustus II the Strong built lavish baroque palaces in Dresden and Warsaw."}, {"question": "What was the main pursuit of Augustus II the Strong?", "answer": "The main pursuit of Augustus II the Strong was bolstering royal power in the Commonwealth."}, {"question": "Who was installed as king by the Swedes in 1704?", "answer": "The Swedes installed nobleman Stanisław Leszczyński as king in 1704."}, {"question": "Where is the burial place of Augustus II the Strong?", "answer": "The burial place of Augustus II the Strong is in Poland's royal Wawel Cathedral in Kraków."}, {"question": "Where is the heart of Augustus II the Strong?", "answer": "The heart of Augustus II the Strong rests in the Dresden Cathedral."}]}

Abercrombie was the illegitimate son of James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton. He joined the Royal Scots as an ensign on 24 May 1696, and fought in the Battle of Blenheim in 1704 as Aide-de-Camp to George Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney. He became brevet major in 1706 and captain on 31 May 1707. He was created baronet on 21 May 1709. He subsequently served as a captain and lieutenant-colonel in the Coldstream Guards from 1710 to 1711. Abercrombie was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dysart Burghs at a by-election on 16 January 1710 and held the seat until the dissolution of parliament on 21 September 1710. He chose not to stand for re-election, and his successor as the member for Dysart Burghs, James Oswald, was elected unopposed at the 1710 British general election. Abercrombie became lieutenant-colonel on 20 March 1711 and brevet colonel on 1 November 1711. On 24 October 1712, he became Town Major (Lieutenant-Governor) of Dunkirk and as such, oversaw the evacuation of French forces and the installation of an allied garrison, holding the post for the rest of his life. He was commissioner for inspecting the demolition of Dunkirk fortifications from 1713 to 1716, accumulating extensive arrears of pay and allowance.

Born in Racha, in western Georgia, Svanidze eventually moved to Tiflis with her two sisters and brother, and worked as a seamstress. Her brother Alexander was a confidant of Stalin, then still known by his birth name of Ioseb Jughashvili, and introduced him to Svanidze in 1905. They were married in 1906 and she gave birth to Yakov a few months later. The family moved to Baku to avoid arrest, though Svanidze got quite ill there and returned to Tiflis in 1907, dying shortly after her return, likely from typhus or tuberculosis.

{"title": "Marcus Garvey", "passage": "Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr. ONH (17 August 188710 June 1940) was a Jamaican political activist, publisher, journalist, entrepreneur, and orator. He was the founder and first President-General of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL, commonly known as UNIA), through which he declared himself Provisional President of Africa. Ideologically a black nationalist and Pan-Africanist, his ideas came to be known as Garveyism. Garvey was born to a moderately prosperous Afro-Jamaican family in Saint Ann's Bay, Colony of Jamaica and apprenticed into the print trade as a teenager. Working in Kingston, he became involved in trade unionism before living briefly in Costa Rica, Panama, and England. Returning to Jamaica, he founded UNIA in 1914. In 1916, he moved to the United States and established a UNIA branch in New York City's Harlem district. Emphasising unity between Africans and the African diaspora, he campaigned for an end to European colonial rule across Africa and the political unification of the continent. He envisioned a unified Africa as a one-party state, governed by himself, that would enact laws to ensure black racial purity. Although he never visited the continent, he was committed to the Back-to-Africa movement, arguing that many African-Americans should migrate there. Garveyist ideas became increasingly popular and UNIA grew in membership. However, his black separatist views—and his collaboration with white racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) to advance their shared interest in racial separatism—divided Garvey from other prominent African-American civil rights activists such as W. E. B. Du Bois who promoted racial integration. Committed to the belief that African-Americans needed to secure financial independence from white-dominant society, Garvey launched various businesses in the U.S., including the Negro Factories Corporation and \"Negro World\" newspaper. In 1919, he became President of the Black Star Line shipping and passenger company, designed to forge a link between North America and Africa and facilitate African-American migration to Liberia. In 1923 Garvey was convicted of mail fraud for selling the company's stock and imprisoned in the Atlanta State Penitentiary for nearly two years. Many commentators have argued that the trial was politically motivated; Garvey blamed Jewish people, claiming that they were prejudiced against him because of his links to the KKK. Deported to Jamaica in 1927, where he settled in Kingston with his wife Amy Jacques, Garvey continued his activism and established the People's Political Party in 1929, briefly serving as a city councillor. With UNIA in increasing financial difficulty, in 1935 he relocated to London, where his anti-socialist stance distanced him from many of the city's black activists. He died there in 1940, although in 1964 his body was returned to Jamaica for reburial in Kingston's National Heroes Park. Garvey was a controversial figure. Many in the African diasporic community regarded him as a pretentious demagogue and were highly critical of his collaboration with white supremacists, his violent rhetoric, and his prejudice against mixed-race people and Jews. He nevertheless received praise for encouraging a sense of pride and self-worth among Africans and the African diaspora amid widespread poverty, discrimination, and colonialism. He is seen as a national hero in Jamaica, and his ideas exerted a considerable influence on movements like Rastafari, the Nation of Islam, and the Black Power Movement.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was the founder and first President-General of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL)?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey was the founder and first President-General of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL)."}, {"question": "When was Marcus Garvey born?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey was born on 17 August 1887."}, {"question": "Where was Marcus Garvey born?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey was born in Saint Ann's Bay, Colony of Jamaica."}, {"question": "What was the name of the newspaper founded by Marcus Garvey?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey founded the 'Negro World' newspaper."}, {"question": "What was the name of the shipping and passenger company founded by Marcus Garvey?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey founded the Black Star Line shipping and passenger company."}, {"question": "Why was Marcus Garvey convicted of mail fraud?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey was convicted of mail fraud for selling the stock of the Black Star Line shipping and passenger company."}, {"question": "Where was Marcus Garvey imprisoned?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey was imprisoned in the Atlanta State Penitentiary."}, {"question": "Why did Marcus Garvey blame Jewish people?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey blamed Jewish people, claiming that they were prejudiced against him because of his links to the Ku Klux Klan."}, {"question": "What was the name of the party founded by Marcus Garvey in 1929?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey founded the People's Political Party in 1929."}, {"question": "Where did Marcus Garvey relocate to in 1935?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey relocated to London in 1935."}, {"question": "Why did Marcus Garvey's body return to Jamaica in 1964?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey's body was returned to Jamaica for reburial in Kingston's National Heroes Park in 1964."}, {"question": "What is Marcus Garvey regarded as in Jamaica?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey is regarded as a national hero in Jamaica."}, {"question": "What movements was Marcus Garvey's ideas influential in?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey's ideas exerted a considerable influence on movements like Rastafari, the Nation of Islam, and the Black Power Movement."}]}

{"title": "Coretta Scott King", "passage": "Coretta Scott King (née Scott; April 27, 1927 – January 30, 2006) was an American author, activist, civil rights leader, and the wife of Martin Luther King Jr. An active advocate for African-American equality , she was a leader for the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. King was also a singer who often incorporated music into her civil rights work. King met her husband while attending graduate school in Boston. They both became increasingly active in the American Civil Rights Movement. King played a prominent role in the years after her husband's assassination in 1968 when she took on the leadership of the struggle for racial equality herself and became active in the Women's Movement. King founded the King Center and sought to make his birthday a national holiday. She finally succeeded when Ronald Reagan signed legislation which established Martin Luther King Jr. Day on November 2, 1983. She later broadened her scope to include both advocacy for LGBT rights and opposition to apartheid. King became friends with many politicians before and after Martin Luther King's death, including John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Robert F. Kennedy. Her telephone conversation with John F.

{"title": "Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham", "passage": "Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, 6th Earl of Stafford, (December 1402 – 10 July 1460) was an English nobleman and a military commander in the Hundred Years' War and the Wars of the Roses. Through his mother he had royal descent from King Edward III, his great-grandfather, and from his father, he inherited, at an early age, the earldom of Stafford. By his marriage to a daughter of Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, Humphrey was related to the powerful Neville family and to many of the leading aristocratic houses of the time. He joined the English campaign in France with King Henry V in 1420 and following Henry V's death two years later he became a councillor for the new King, the nine-month-old Henry VI. Stafford acted as a peacemaker during the partisan, factional politics of the 1430s, when Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, vied with Cardinal Beaufort for political supremacy. Stafford also took part in the eventual arrest of Gloucester in 1447. Stafford returned to the French campaign during the 1430s and for his loyalty and years of service, he was elevated from Earl of Stafford to Duke of Buckingham. Around the same time, his mother died. As much of his estate—as her dower—had previously been in her hands, Humphrey went from having a reduced income in his early years to being one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners in England. His lands stretched across much of the country, ranging from East Anglia to the Welsh border. Being such an important figure in the localities was not without its dangers and for some time he feuded violently with Sir Thomas Malory in the Midlands. After returning from France, Stafford remained in England for the rest of his life, serving King Henry. He acted as the King's bodyguard and chief negotiator during Jack Cade's rebellion of 1450, helping to suppress it. When the King's cousin, Richard, Duke of York, rebelled two years later, Stafford investigated York's followers. In 1453, the King became ill and sank into a catatonic state; law and order broke down further and when civil war began in 1455, Stafford fought for the King in the First Battle of St Albans which began the Wars of the Roses. Both were captured by the Yorkists and Stafford spent most of his final years attempting to mediate between the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions, the latter by now headed by Henry's wife, Margaret of Anjou. Partly due to a feud with a leading Yorkist—Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick—Stafford eventually declared for King Henry and the Duke of York was defeated in 1459, driving York into exile. When the rebels returned the following year they attacked the royal army at Northampton. Acting as the King's personal guard in the ensuing struggle, Stafford was killed and the King was again taken prisoner.

{"title": "Ali ibn Abu Bakr al-Haythami", "passage": "Nur al- Din` Ali ibn Abi Bakr ibn Sulayman, Abu al- Hasan al- Haythami( 735 AH 1335 CE – 807AH 1404 CE) was a Sunni Shafi`i Islamic scholar from Cairo, whose father had a shop on a desert road. He was born in the month of Rajab in 735 H. corresponding to 1335 CE. He learned the Qur'an and memorized it, and when he was a teenager, he became a disciple of a highly renowned scholar of Hadith, Abd Al- Raheem ibn Al- Hussain ibn Abd Al- Rahman, who was better known as Zain Al- Deen Al- Iraqi. Al- Haythami became a committed associate of Al- Iraqi, staying with him all the time, traveling with him when he traveled, and offering the pilgrimage in his company. He attended with him every circle he attended in Cairo, other cities in Egypt, Makkah, Madinah, Jerusalem, Damascus, Baalbak, Aleppo and other places. The only teacher under whom Al- Haythami read, without being attended by Al- Iraqi, was Ibn Abd Al- Hadi, from whom he heard the Sahih collection of Imam Muslim. On the other hand, Al- Iraqi heard from only four teachers without Al- Haythami taking part. Al- Iraqi, who was only ten years older than Al- Haythami, was a highly distinguished scholar of Hadith. Al- Haythami was also to distinguish himself as a scholar of Hadith, but despite his broad scholarly achievement, he preferred to remain in the shadow of his teacher and friend, Al- Iraqi. Indeed, Al- Iraqi relied on Al- Haythami in conducting much of his affairs, and gave him his daughter in marriage. He trained him in a particular area of Hadith scholarship and Al- Haythami was to achieve distinction in this field and to produce highly valuable works in it. This is the area of Zawa’id which we will presently discuss. Al- Haythami was exemplary in his religious devotion, and his serious approach to Hadith scholarship. He cared little for worldly matters, which are the main preoccupation of many people, dedicating himself to the study of Hadith, and associating only with Hadith scholars. While Al- Iraqi was alive, he taught Hadith in his presence. Similarly, Al- Iraqi rarely taught without Al- Haythami being present. But after Al- Iraqi's death, he was sought by many students who wished to read under him. He taught unhesitatingly, but without assuming any personal distinction. He is praised by many scholars for his humility, kindly manner, and dedication to learning. Ibn Hajar, a Hadith scholar of the highest caliber who studied much under Al- Haythami, describes him as very kind, highly critical of anyone indulging in a practice that is unacceptable to Islam, yet he was extremely tolerant when it came to personal grievances. When other students of Al- Iraqi repeatedly tried to irritate him, he simply tolerated them without much complaint. While many scholars mention his commitment to his teacher, showing him great respect in all situations, all are agreed that his own knowledge was broad, and that he distinguished himself by his great achievement in Hadith scholarship. They are also agreed that he was highly devoted in his worship, very pious and very kind in his dealing with other people. As we have already said, Al- Haythami distinguished himself in a particular area of Hadith scholarship, namely Zawa’id, which linguistically means ‘ addition or increase ’. This is a comparative study seeking to identify all the Hadiths that are listed in a collection by a distinguished Hadith scholar but are not listed in any of the six main Hadith collections. This is highly useful for students of Hadith, because it identifies for them which Hadiths they need to learn from any particular collection, if they have already learned the six main ones. Moreover, many of these collections, from which Al- Haythami extracted the Zawa’id, are not arranged according to topics of Fiqh, while Al- Haythami arranged them on this basis, which makes for easier reference. Hence, his work is highly valuable. In all, Al- Haythami extracted the Zawa’id from Al- Musnad by Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and also from Al- Bazzar's collection, Ibn Hibban's Sahih, Al- Musnad by Abu Ya’la, as well as the three collections named Al- Mu’jam by Al- Tabarani, and then collected all these and listed them all in one voluminous work which he called Majma ’ Al- Zawa’id wa Manba ’ Al- Fawa’id. He dropped all chains of transmission and arranged his book according to the topics of Fiqh, which is the pattern used in the six main collections of Hadith. He graded each Hadith, pointing out which were authentic and which lacked in authenticity. Alternatively, he would mention names of narrators who were questioned or regarded as unreliable. It should be pointed out that not all Al- Haythami's gradings were acceptable to later Hadith scholars. The book was published in 10 volumes by Qudsi in Cairo about 70 years ago, but more recently, a new annotated edition was published by Dar Al- Fikr in Beirut, Lebanon. The omission of chains of transmission, justified on grounds of brevity, has been felt as a defect in this work, but it remains a great encyclopedia of Hadith. Al- Haythami was praised for it by his contemporaries and by later scholars. Al- Haythami died on 19 Ramadan 807 H, corresponding to 1405 CE.

Petko was born in the Bulgarian village of Dogan Hisar, today Aisymi( Evros regional unit, Greece). He married a Greek lady from Maronia in 1860. When a group of Turkish brigands attacked his wife, he fought and killed them all, including the leader of the bashibuzuks, Mehmed Kesedji Bey. Beginning in 1861 Petko began fighting against the Ottomans in the surrounding areas of Maroneia, Aisymi, Enos etc. He visited Italy in 1866, where he met Giuseppe Garibaldi, who became a close friend. Petko lived in Garibaldi's home for a few months. Garibaldi helped Petko organize the well- known\" Garibaldi Battalion\" in the Cretan Revolution of 1866 – 1869, consisting of 220 Italians and 67 Bulgarians, who fought the Ottomans on Crete under Petko's command. For his service, Petko was assigned the military title of\" Kapetan\"( Captain). Petko Voyvoda's detachment, established in 1869, took part in the Russo- Turkish War of 1877- 78. His unit liberated Maroneia from the Turkish rule in December 1877, establishing a Christian government there. He fought against the Turks for three months and saved the local population from Turkish oppression. After that, he took part in the liberation of the Rhodopes together with Kraycho Voyvoda. As part of this effort, he led the defeat of the 1878 Muslim insurgence in the Rhodopes organized by the British agent Saint Clair. With his son and new wife Rada Kravkova from Kazanlak Petko lived in Varna after 1880 and died in that city in 1900. He founded the revolutionary committee called\" Strandzha\" there in 1896. His revolutionary work has been commemorated with numerous monuments all around Bulgaria, as well as in his native village in modern Greece and on the hill of Gianicolo in Rome, where a monument of Garibaldi also stands. The TV series\" Captain Petko Voivode\" written by Nikolay Haytov and first aired in 1981 also popularized him as a national hero. There are several Bulgarian patriotic songs dedicated to Petko and his comrades. Petko Voyvoda Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is also named in his honor.

He appears regularly on television, newspapers and websites, usually concentrating on horse racing and football, such as\" The Daily Telegraph\" and online bookmaker Easyodds, writing tipping sections every day. He has also provided English language football commentary for Eurosport and ESPN. He is currently a commentator for BT Sport on their coverage of the Bundesliga, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. He first worked for Ladbrokes, providing racing commentary into their betting shops, but rose to fame as\" Statto\", the resident statistician on the BBC Two television show\" Fantasy Football League\". Clad in a dressing gown and pyjamas, he would stand in the corner of the set and provide facts and figures on each of the guests' fantasy football teams, while being made fun of by hosts Frank Skinner and David Baddiel. He also appeared in the Rowan Atkinson comedy film\" Bean\" in 1997 and the Mel Smith directed\" Blackball\" in 2003. He is the son of conductor James Loughran and was educated at Ampleforth College. He is a fan of Manchester United F.C.. As a 15- year- old, Loughran was involved in an elaborate prank on Chris Tavaré during a cricket Test match:\" The crowd of just 1,444 showed their disgust, crying\" boring, boring, boring\" repeatedly as Tavaré and England continued to bat on and on. Before too long, a 15- year- old boy appeared at the wicket holding a stool, apparently indicating to the batsman that he must need a rest after batting for such a long time. The boy in question was the young Angus Loughran, or Fantasy Football's Statto as he would later become known.

{"title": "Deep Blue Sea (1999 film)", "passage": "Deep Blue Sea is a 1999 American science fiction horror film directed by Renny Harlin. It stars Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Rapaport, and rapper LL Cool J. Set in an isolated underwater facility, the film follows a team of scientists and their research on mako sharks to help fight Alzheimer's disease. The situation plunges into chaos when multiple genetically engineered sharks go on a rampage and flood the facility. \" Deep Blue Sea\" had a budget of$ 82 million and represented a test for Harlin, who had not made a commercially successful film since\" Cliffhanger\" in 1993. The film was primarily shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron's 1997 film\" Titanic\". Although\" Deep Blue Sea\" features some shots of real sharks, most of the sharks used in the film were either animatronic or computer generated. Trevor Rabin composed the film score; LL Cool J contributed two songs to the film:\" Deepest Bluest( Shark's Fin)\" and\" Say What\". Released in theaters during the film industry's summer season,\" Deep Blue Sea\" was a moderate commercial success, grossing more than$ 73 million in the United States and Canada, and$ 164 million worldwide. The film received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised its suspense, pacing, and action sequences. Criticism was targeted at its unoriginality and B movie conventions.

William was born in and died in Düsseldorf. He was the only son of John III, Duke of Jülich- Cleves- Berg, and Maria, Duchess of Jülich- Berg. William took over rule of his father's estates( the Duchy of Cleves and the County of Mark) upon his death in 1539. Despite his mother having lived until 1543, William also became the Duke of Berg and Jülich and the Count of Ravensberg. From 1538 to 1543, William held the neighbouring Duchy of Guelders, as successor of his distant relatives, the Egmond dukes. Emperor Charles V claimed this duchy for himself as the dukes had sold their right of heritage, and William tried to hold on to it. He made a treaty with the King of France and married Jeanne d'Albret, and with this backup dared to challenge the Emperor. All too soon he learned that the French did not lift a finger to help him, and he was overwhelmed and had to surrender. In accordance with the Treaty of Venlo( 1543) that was the result of this war, Guelders and the County of Zutphen were transferred to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, combining them with the Habsburg Netherlands. William then tried to strengthen his inherited territories and launched an impressive development project for the most important cities. The three duchies all got new main fortresses as major strongpoints, for the older medieval fortifications had proved to be no match against the Imperial artillery. The cities of Jülich, Düsseldorf and Orsoy became fortresses for the duchies of Jülich, Berg and Cleves respectively, and Jülich and Düsseldorf were turned into impressive residences. For this task, the renowned Italian architect Alessandro Pasqualini from Bologna was hired, who had already made some impressive display of his craft in the Netherlands. He made the plans for the fortifications and palaces, of which some traces still remain, especially at Jülich where the citadel( built 1548- 1580) is a major landmark, with parts of the Renaissance palace still standing. William's sister Anne of Cleves was, for six months, the fourth wife of King Henry VIII of England.

Maria became heiress to her father's estates of Jülich, Berg and Ravensberg after his death in 1511. In her marriage to John III, Duke of Cleves in 1509, Maria's estates and titles were eventually merged with the Duchy of Cleves. John, who inherited the Duchy of Cleves-Mark in 1521, then became the first ruler of the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, which would exist until 1666. She married John III, Duke of Cleves in 1509, by whom she had three daughters and a son. Sybille (1512–1554), William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg (\"Wilhelm\") (1516–1592), Amalia (1517–1586), and Anne (1515–1557) who was Queen consort of England from 6 January 1540 to 9 July 1540 to King Henry VIII. Maria was a strict, traditional Catholic and not a proponent of educating princesses and noble women, which by this point was the norm for the English nobility and gentry. In \"The Wives of Henry VIII\", Antonia Fraser suggests that, following their marriage, one reason Henry VIII disliked her daughter Anne so much was that, unlike his first two wives and many of the court ladies around him, Anne did not possess educational and musical accomplishments and was ill-equipped to function in the contentious English court.

{"title": "Magdalene of Jülich-Cleves-Berg", "passage": "Duchess Magdalene of Jülich-Cleves-Berg (2 November 1553 – 30 August 1633) was the fifth child of Duke William \"the rich\" of Jülich-Cleves-Berg and Maria of Austria, a daughter of Emperor Ferdinand I. She married in 1579 with Count Palatine John I \"the lame\" of Zweibrücken. Emperor Charles V had in 1546 granted the Duchy of Jülich-Cleves-Berg the right of female succession. So, when her brother, Duke John William, died in 1609 without a male heir of his own, both she and William's daughters could play a vital role in the question of who would inherit the important northwest German territory. Magdalene's husband John claimed the inheritance for Palatinate-Zweibrücken, as did the Elector of Brandenburg, John Sigismund, who was married to Anna, a daughter of Magdalena's sister Marie Eleonore (John Sigismund claimed his marriage contract from 1573 gave him the best claim). The third claimant was Count Palatine Philip Louis of Neuburg, the husband of Magdalen's other sister Anna. Finally, the Duchy of Saxony claimed Jülich-Cleves-Berg, based on an agreement to that effect with the Emperor. Since all claimants were members of comprehensive European coalitions and so the Habsburgs and France were indirectly involved, an international conflict threatened: the War of the Jülich succession. However, after King Henry IV of France died, the conflict could be settled provisionally by the Treaty of Xanten. The duchy was divided between Brandenburg and Palatinate-Neuburg. In the meantime, Magdalena's husband had died in 1604 and his claim had been inherited by her eldest son John II (1584–1635), who did not receive a share under the Treaty of Xanten. Magdalene's daughter Elisabeth (1581–1637) married Georg Gustav, Count Palatine of Pfalz-Veldenz. She also had two younger sons: Frederick Casimir (1585–1645) and John Casimir (1589–1652).

{"title": "Fleetwood Sheppard", "passage": "Fleetwood Sheppard (sometimes spelled as \"Shepphard,Sheppheard,\" and \"Sheppeard\") (1 January 1634 – 25 August 1698) was a British courtier and literary wit who was instrumental in the courts of Charles II of England and William of Orange. He was an educated man known for his lively wit and honesty, and he was an important figure in the poetry of the 1680s and 1690s. He was born in Oxfordshire, attended Magdalen Hall and Christ Church, Oxford, gaining the Bachelor of Arts in 1654 and Master of Arts in 1657. When all persons attaining an M.A. were required to join the Church of England, King Charles intervened and said that Sheppard had a background in civil law (having studied at Gray's Inn) and was \"not prepared to take orders, he being a person of much ability\" (Ellis 255). Instead, Sheppard became a courtier. He was introduced to Nell Gwynn and became one of her favourite companions, along with Charles Sackville, Lord Buckhurst (later Earl of Dorset). He would remain one of Dorset's closest friends throughout his life. While satirists and gossips (such as Anthony á Wood) said that Sheppard spent his time as \"a debauchee and atheist, a grand companion,\" others suggested that he was a fundamentally honest man who was always interested in a good joke. He became one of Charles II's dining companions, and when Nell Gwynn gave birth to a male child, he was made the steward of Gwynn's household. This prompted a satirist to accuse him of being the best paid pimp in the land. There is little truth to this charge, however, as Sheppard was not paid by the crown for his services, except for two grants of £200. Dorset and Sheppard went to Paris together. Additionally, Dorset would travel out to meet Sheppard when the latter went out to the country. Whether he and Dorset got in trouble in Paris for some scandalous behaviour, as Wood suggests, or not, it is true that Sheppard lived a very active life. He was stabbed beneath the eye while separating Henry Bulkeley and George Etheridge in a quarrel in a tavern. Sheppard was not liked by James II, and Sheppard did not like James, either. When Charles II died, Sheppard went into retirement. However, when William came to the throne, Sheppard was back at court and back in favour. Dorset was made the chamberlain of the royal household, and that gave him a great many places to dispense in patronage. For this, he employed Sheppard. Sheppard received the proceeds from those wishing to purchase places, and he received the favours of those wishing a good word to be placed on their behalf. At the same time, Sheppard was a favourite of the new Queen's, and John Oldmixon said that he made the Queen \"very merry.\" In \"A New Way of Selling Places at Court\" in 1712, Jonathan Swift would say that Fleetwood Sheppard sold places that did not exist and named successors for posts that were not vacant, that he enriched himself greatly. In 1690 he was made a gentleman usher to the king. In 1694 he was knighted, became a gentleman usher to the black rod in the House of Lords, and was inducted as a knight of the garter. Sheppard was a patron of many poets and one of those who discovered others. He was one of the ones, for example, who \"discoveredParadise Lost\" when Buckhurst bought it from a small stall at a fair. He was also present when Matthew Prior was discovered reading Horace as a tap puller in a bar and sent to school to cultivate his talents. He was also one of the main supports of Robert Gould, as well as John Oldmixon. He may have embraced the Puritan cause around 1695, and some of his old friends were disaffected by this change. Charles Gildon, Thomas Rymer, and John Dennis dedicated volumes of literary criticism to Sheppard, and John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester regarded Sheppard as the only critic he needed for his verses. In his last years, Sheppard was reported dead several times before he died. In 1694, Lord Godolphin heard a report that Sheppard had died, but Sheppard himself responded, saying that he was alive, but that he had suffered from \"the stone\" for twelve to fourteen years. In December 1697, he was again reported as dead. In July 1698, he was \"again\" reported as dead. He did die shortly afterward, but in 1768 a joking \"Annual Register\" announced that Sheppard was still alive, in good health, and 120 years old.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was Fleetwood Sheppard?", "answer": "Fleetwood Sheppard was a British courtier and literary wit."}, {"question": "When was Fleetwood Sheppard born?", "answer": "Fleetwood Sheppard was born on 1 January 1634."}, {"question": "Where was Fleetwood Sheppard born?", "answer": "Fleetwood Sheppard was born in Oxfordshire."}, {"question": "What was Fleetwood Sheppard's education?", "answer": "Fleetwood Sheppard attended Magdalen Hall and Christ Church, Oxford, gaining the Bachelor of Arts in 1654 and Master of Arts in 1657."}, {"question": "What was Fleetwood Sheppard's role in the court of Charles II?", "answer": "Fleetwood Sheppard was a courtier and became one of Charles II's dining companions."}, {"question": "Who was Fleetwood Sheppard's companion, along with Charles Sackville, Lord Buckhurst?", "answer": "Fleetwood Sheppard was one of Nell Gwynn's favourite companions, along with Charles Sackville, Lord Buckhurst."}, {"question": "What was Fleetwood Sheppard's role in Nell Gwynn's household?", "answer": "Fleetwood Sheppard was made the steward of Nell Gwynn's household."}, {"question": "What was Fleetwood Sheppard's relationship with James II?", "answer": "Fleetwood Sheppard was not liked by James II, and Sheppard did not like James, either."}, {"question": "What was Fleetwood Sheppard's role in the court of William of Orange?", "answer": "Fleetwood Sheppard was back at court and back in favour when William came to the throne."}, {"question": "What was Fleetwood Sheppard's role in the discovery of poets?", "answer": "Fleetwood Sheppard was one of those who discovered others, such as John Oldmixon and Robert Gould."}, {"question": "What was Fleetwood Sheppard's role in the literary world?", "answer": "Fleetwood Sheppard was a patron of many poets and one of those who discovered others."}, {"question": "When did Fleetwood Sheppard die?", "answer": "Fleetwood Sheppard died in 1698."}, {"question": "What was Fleetwood Sheppard's health condition?", "answer": "Fleetwood Sheppard suffered from 'the stone' for twelve to fourteen years."}]}

{"title": "Matilda of Hainaut", "passage": "Matilda of Hainaut( 29 November 1293 – 1331) was the Princess of Achaea from 1313 to 1318. She was the daughter of Isabella of Villehardouin and her husband Florent of Hainaut. In 1299, while still a child, she had been married to Guy II de la Roche, Duke of Athens. Widowed in 1308, she was engaged to Charles of Taranto until 1313, when she remarried to Louis of Burgundy, who held the titular dignity of the long- extinct Kingdom of Thessalonica. The marriage was intended to unite the Angevin and Burgundian houses. So was the betrothal of the Empress Catherine II to Hugh V of Burgundy, Louis's elder brother. However, Charles of Valois, Catherine's father, nixed the marriage and instead married her to Philip of Taranto. It was in an effort to compensate the Burgundians that Philip renounced his claim to Achaea in favour of Matilda and gave her hand to Louis. From 1307, when Philip of Savoy relinquished his claim, to 1312, when Isabella of Villehardouin died, Achaea was disputed between two claimants: Isabella and Philip I of Taranto. In 1313, Philip granted it to Matilda, daughter of Isabella and her first husband Florent of Hainaut. On Isabella's death, however, Ferdinand of Majorca laid claim to the principality in right of his wife, Isabella of Sabran, the daughter of Isabella's younger sister Margaret of Villehardouin. The new couple quickly left for Greece to take possession of their fief, which was then occupied by their rival Ferdinand. At the Battle of Manolada on 5 July 1316, Ferdinand was vanquished and killed and Louis took control of the Elis. However, he was poisoned soon after, leaving a twice- widowed 23- year- old in charge of the Morea. It was soon disputed by the varying claimants and Matilda was solidly dispossessed of her fief by 1318, in which year John, Duke of Durazzo, an Angevin, abducted the princess and forced her to marry him. She did not give him children, however, and he repudiated her in 1321. Matilda married yet again to Hugh de La Palice and retired to Aversa, where she died in 1331.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was the Princess of Achaea from 1313 to 1318?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut was the Princess of Achaea from 1313 to 1318."}, {"question": "Who was Matilda of Hainaut's first husband?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut's first husband was Guy II de la Roche, Duke of Athens."}, {"question": "Who was Matilda of Hainaut's second husband?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut's second husband was Charles of Taranto."}, {"question": "Who was Matilda of Hainaut's third husband?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut's third husband was Louis of Burgundy."}, {"question": "Who was Matilda of Hainaut's fourth husband?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut's fourth husband was John, Duke of Durazzo."}, {"question": "Who was Matilda of Hainaut's fifth husband?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut's fifth husband was Hugh de La Palice."}, {"question": "When was Matilda of Hainaut born?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut was born on 29 November 1293."}, {"question": "When did Matilda of Hainaut die?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut died in 1331."}, {"question": "Who was Matilda of Hainaut's mother?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut's mother was Isabella of Villehardouin."}, {"question": "Who was Matilda of Hainaut's father?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut's father was Florent of Hainaut."}, {"question": "Who was Matilda of Hainaut's brother-in-law?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut's brother-in-law was Philip of Taranto."}, {"question": "Who was Matilda of Hainaut's sister-in-law?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut's sister-in-law was Isabella of Sabran."}, {"question": "Who was Matilda of Hainaut's rival for the principality of Achaea?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut's rival for the principality of Achaea was Ferdinand of Majorca."}, {"question": "Who was Matilda of Hainaut's husband at the Battle of Manolada?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut's husband at the Battle of Manolada was Louis of Burgundy."}, {"question": "Who was Matilda of Hainaut's husband after Louis of Burgundy?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut's husband after Louis of Burgundy was John, Duke of Durazzo."}, {"question": "Who was Matilda of Hainaut's husband after John, Duke of Durazzo?", "answer": "Matilda of Hainaut's husband after John, Duke of Durazzo was Hugh de La Palice."}]}

He was born in Goindval, in the Punjab, the youngest son of Bhai Jetha, who later became Guru Ram Das, and Mata Bhani, the daughter of Guru Amar Das. He was the first Guru in Sikhism to be born into a Sikh family. Guru Arjan led Sikhism for a quarter of a century. He completed the construction of Darbar Sahib at Amritsar, after the fourth Sikh Guru founded the town and built a pool. Guru Arjan compiled the hymns of previous Gurus and of other saints into Adi Granth, the first edition of the Sikh scripture, and installed it in the Harimandir Sahib. Guru Arjan reorganized the Masands system initiated by Guru Ram Das, by suggesting that the Sikhs donate, if possible, one-tenth of their income, goods or service to the Sikh organization (\"dasvand\"). The \"Masand\" not only collected these funds but also taught tenets of Sikhism and settled civil disputes in their region. The \"dasvand\" financed the building of gurdwaras and langars (shared communal kitchens). Guru Arjan was arrested under the orders of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir and asked to convert to Islam. He refused, was tortured and executed in 1606 CE. Historical records and the Sikh tradition are unclear whether Guru Arjan was executed by drowning or died during torture.

{"title": "Tlacaelel", "passage": "Tlacaelel I (1397 – 1487) was the principal architect of the Aztec Triple Alliance and hence the Mexica (Aztec) empire. He was the son of Emperor Huitzilihuitl and Queen Cacamacihuatl, nephew of Emperor Itzcoatl, father of poet Macuilxochitzin, and brother of Emperors Chimalpopoca and Moctezuma I. During the reign of his uncle Itzcoatl, Tlacaelel was given the office of Tlacochcalcatl, but during the war against the Tepanecs in the late 1420s, he was promoted to first adviser to the ruler, a position called \"Cihuacoatl\" in Nahuatl, an office that Tlacaelel held during the reigns of four consecutive \"Tlatoque\", until his death in 1487. Tlacaelel recast or strengthened the concept of the Aztecs as a chosen people, elevated the tribal god/hero Huitzilopochtli to top of the pantheon of gods, and increased militarism. In tandem with this, Tlacaelel is said to have increased the level and prevalence of human sacrifice, particularly during a period of natural disasters that started in 1446 (according to Diego Durán). Durán also states that it was during the reign of Moctezuma I, as an invention of Tlacaelel that the flower wars, in which the Aztecs fought Tlaxcala and other Nahuan city-states, were instigated. To strengthen the Aztec nobility, he helped create and enforce sumptuary laws, prohibiting commoners from wearing certain adornments such as lip plugs, gold armbands, and cotton cloaks. He also instigated a policy of burning the books of conquered peoples with the aim of erasing all memories of a pre-Aztec past. When he dedicated the seventh reconstruction of the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan, Tlacaelel had brought his nation to the height of its power. The dedication took place in 1484 and was celebrated with the sacrifice of many war captives.

{"title": "Thomas Koppel", "passage": "Thomas Koppel (27 April 1944 – 25 February 2006) was a Danish classical music and avant-garde popular composer and musician. His father, Herman David Koppel (1908-1998), a composer and pianist of Jewish origin, fled the Nazis with his family in 1943. Thomas was born in a refugee camp in Sweden. The family moved to Denmark and Thomas studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Music with his father who was professor of piano. Like his father, Thomas Koppel became a classical pianist and composer. He wrote string quartets, a piano concerto, operas, cantatas, a ballet, symphonies and other orchestral works. At age 18 he completed his first opera \"The Story of a Mother\", based on a tale by Hans Christian Andersen. Koppel composed the score in 1971 for the ballet \"Dødens Triumf\" (Triumph of Death) which was danced naked at the Royal Danish Theatre. Unlike his father, Thomas Koppel also composed and performed avant-garde popular music. He founded the experimental rock group \"Savage Rose\" with his brother Anders and sister Lone. In 1968 they added four more members including the singer Annisette. Aside from rock, the group fused elements from classical music, jazz and rhythm and blues. Thomas Koppel and Annisette later became partners and married. They were deeply committed to projects to promote peace and social justice and in 1996 moved to Los Angeles drawn by its cultural and social diversity, including the homeless.

{"title": "Claudius", "passage": "Claudius (1 August 10 BC – 13 October AD 54) was a Roman emperor from AD 41 to 54. Born to Drusus and Antonia Minor at Lugdunum in Roman Gaul, where his father was stationed as a military legate, he was the first Roman emperor to be born outside Italy. Nonetheless, Claudius was an Italic of Sabine origins and a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his consulship, shared with his nephew Caligula in 37. Claudius's infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of Tiberius' and Caligula's reigns; potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. His survival led to his being declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last man of his family. Despite his lack of experience, Claudius proved to be an able and efficient administrator. He expanded the imperial bureaucracy to include freedmen, and helped to restore the empire's finances after the excess of Caligula's reign. He was also an ambitious builder, constructing many new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Empire. During his reign the Empire started its successful conquest of Britain. Having a personal interest in law, he presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day. He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, particularly by elements of the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position; this resulted in the deaths of many senators. These events damaged his reputation among the ancient writers, though more recent historians have revised this opinion. Many authors contend that he was murdered by his own wife. After his death in 54 (at the age of 63), his grand-nephew, step-son, and adopted son Nero succeeded him as emperor. His 13-year reign (slightly longer than Nero's) would not be surpassed by any successors until that of Domitian, who reigned for 15 years. He was a descendant of the Octavii Rufi (through Gaius Octavius), Julii Caesares (through Julia Minor and Julia Antonia), and the Claudii Nerones (through Nero Claudius Drusus). He was a step-grandson (through his father Drusus) and great-nephew (through his mother Antonia Minor) of Augustus. He was a nephew of Tiberius through his father, Tiberius's brother. Through his brother Germanicus, Claudius was an uncle of Caligula and a great uncle of Nero.

{"title": "Otto von Habsburg", "passage": "Otto von Habsburg (20 November 1912 4 July 2011), also known by his traditional royal title of Archduke Otto of Austria, was the last Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary from 1916 until the dissolution of the empire in 1919, a realm which comprised modern-day Austria, Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, and parts of Italy, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine. He became the pretender to the former thrones, Head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, and Sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1922, upon the death of his father. He resigned as Sovereign of the Golden Fleece in 2000 and as head of the Imperial House in 2007. The eldest son of Charles I and IV, the last Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, and his wife, Zita of Bourbon-Parma, Otto was born as third in line to the thrones, as Archduke Otto of Austria, Royal Prince of Hungary, Bohemia, and Croatia. With his father's accession to the thrones in 1916, he was likely to become emperor and king. As his father never abdicated, Otto was considered by himself, his family and Austro-Hungarian legitimists to be the rightful emperor-king from 1922. Otto was active on the Austrian and European political stage from the 1930s, both by promoting the cause of Habsburg restoration and as an early proponent of European integration—being thoroughly disgusted with nationalism—and a fierce opponent of Nazism and communism. He has been described as one of the leaders of the Austrian Resistance. After the 1938 \"Anschluss\", where monarchists were severely persecuted in Austria and sentenced to death by the Nazis, Otto fled Europe to the United States. Otto von Habsburg was Vice President (1957–1973) and President (1973–2004) of the International Paneuropean Union, and served as a Member of the European Parliament for the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU) from 1979 to 1999. As a newly elected Member of the European Parliament in 1979, Otto had an empty chair set up for the countries on the other side of the Iron Curtain in the European Parliament, and took a strong interest in the countries behind the Iron Curtain. Otto von Habsburg played a notable role in the revolutions of 1989, as a co-initiator of the Pan-European Picnic. Later he was a strong supporter of the EU membership of central and eastern European countries. A noted intellectual, he published several books on historical and political affairs. Otto has been described as one of the \"architects of the European idea and of European integration\" together with Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer, and Alcide De Gasperi. Otto was exiled in 1919 and grew up mostly in Spain. His devout Catholic mother raised him according to the old curriculum of Austria-Hungary, preparing him to become a Catholic monarch. During his life in exile, he lived in Switzerland, Madeira, Spain, Belgium, France, the United States, and from 1954 until his death, finally in Bavaria (Germany), in the residence \"Villa Austria\". At the time of his death, he was a citizen of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Croatia ,having earlier been stateless \"de jure\" and \"de facto\", and possessed passports of Monaco, the Order of Malta, and Spain. His funeral took place at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna on 16 July 2011; he was entombed in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna and his heart buried in Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was the last Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary?", "answer": "Otto von Habsburg was the last Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary."}, {"question": "When did Otto von Habsburg become the pretender to the former thrones?", "answer": "Otto von Habsburg became the pretender to the former thrones in 1922."}, {"question": "What was the name of Otto von Habsburg's father?", "answer": "The name of Otto von Habsburg's father was Charles I and IV, the last Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary."}, {"question": "Who was Otto von Habsburg's wife?", "answer": "Otto von Habsburg's wife was Zita of Bourbon-Parma."}, {"question": "What was Otto von Habsburg's role in the Austrian Resistance?", "answer": "Otto von Habsburg was a fierce opponent of Nazism and communism and has been described as one of the leaders of the Austrian Resistance."}, {"question": "What was the name of the organization Otto von Habsburg was Vice President and President of?", "answer": "The name of the organization Otto von Habsburg was Vice President and President of was the International Paneuropean Union."}, {"question": "For how long was Otto von Habsburg a Member of the European Parliament?", "answer": "Otto von Habsburg was a Member of the European Parliament for the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU) from 1979 to 1999."}, {"question": "What was the name of the event Otto von Habsburg co-initiated?", "answer": "The name of the event Otto von Habsburg co-initiated was the Pan-European Picnic."}, {"question": "Where was Otto von Habsburg's funeral held?", "answer": "Otto von Habsburg's funeral was held at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna."}, {"question": "Where was Otto von Habsburg entombed?", "answer": "Otto von Habsburg was entombed in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna."}, {"question": "Where was Otto von Habsburg's heart buried?", "answer": "Otto von Habsburg's heart was buried in Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary."}]}

{"title": "Henry IV of France", "passage": "Henry IV (read as ; 13 December 1553 – 14 May 1610), also known by the epithet Good King Henry or Henry the Great, was King of Navarre (as Henry III) from 1572 and King of France from 1589 to 1610. He was the first monarch of France from the House of Bourbon, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty. He was assassinated in 1610 by François Ravaillac, a fanatical Catholic, and was succeeded by his son Louis XIII. The son of Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme and Jeanne d'Albret, the Queen of Navarre, Henry was baptised as a Catholic but raised in the Protestant faith by his mother. He inherited the throne of Navarre in 1572 on his mother's death. As a Huguenot, Henry was involved in the French Wars of Religion, barely escaping assassination in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. He later led Protestant forces against the royal army. He and his predecessor Henry III of France were direct descendants of Saint-King Louis IX. Henry III belonged to the House of Valois, descended from Philip III of France, elder son of Saint Louis; Henry IV belonged to the House of Bourbon, descended from Robert, Count of Clermont, younger son of Saint Louis. As Head of the House of Bourbon, Henry was \"first prince of the blood\". Upon the death of his brother-in-law and distant cousin Henry III in 1589, Henry was called to the French succession by the Salic law. He initially kept the Protestant faith (the only French king to do so) and had to fight against the Catholic League, which denied that he could wear France's crown as a Protestant. To obtain mastery over his kingdom, after four years of stalemate, he found it prudent to abjure the Calvinist faith. As a pragmatic politician (in the parlance of the time, a \"politique\"), he displayed an unusual religious tolerance for the era. Notably, he promulgated the Edict of Nantes (1598), which guaranteed religious liberties to Protestants, thereby effectively ending the Wars of Religion. Considered a usurper by some Catholics and a traitor by some Protestants, Henry became target of at least 12 assassination attempts. An unpopular king among his contemporaries, Henry gained more status after his death. He was admired for his repeated victories over his enemies and his conversion to Catholicism. The \"Good King Henryle bon roi Henri\") was remembered for his geniality and his great concern about the welfare of his subjects. An active ruler, he worked to regularise state finance, promote agriculture, eliminate corruption and encourage education. During his reign, the French colonization of the Americas truly began with the foundation of the colony of Acadia and its capital Port-Royal. He was celebrated in the popular song \"Vive le roi Henri\" (which later became an anthem for the French monarchy during the reigns of his successors) and in Voltaire's \"Henriade\".", "qa": [{"question": "Who was the King of Navarre from 1572?", "answer": "Henry III was the King of Navarre from 1572."}, {"question": "Who was the King of France from 1589 to 1610?", "answer": "Henry IV was the King of France from 1589 to 1610."}, {"question": "What was the name of Henry IV's mother?", "answer": "Jeanne d'Albret was the name of Henry IV's mother."}, {"question": "Who assassinated Henry IV?", "answer": "François Ravaillac assassinated Henry IV."}, {"question": "Who succeeded Henry IV?", "answer": "Louis XIII succeeded Henry IV."}, {"question": "What was the name of Henry IV's wife?", "answer": "Henry IV did not have a wife mentioned in the text."}, {"question": "What was the name of Henry IV's son?", "answer": "Louis XIII was the name of Henry IV's son."}, {"question": "What was the name of the House of Bourbon?", "answer": "The House of Bourbon was the name of Henry IV's dynasty."}, {"question": "What was the name of the House of Valois?", "answer": "The House of Valois was the name of Henry III's dynasty."}, {"question": "What was the name of the Edict that Henry IV promulgated?", "answer": "The Edict of Nantes was the name of the Edict that Henry IV promulgated."}, {"question": "What was the purpose of the Edict of Nantes?", "answer": "The purpose of the Edict of Nantes was to guarantee religious liberties to Protestants."}, {"question": "What was the name of the colony that Henry IV founded?", "answer": "The colony of Acadia was the name of the colony that Henry IV founded."}, {"question": "What was the name of the capital of Acadia?", "answer": "Port-Royal was the name of the capital of Acadia."}, {"question": "What was the name of the popular song that celebrated Henry IV?", "answer": "Vive le roi Henri was the name of the popular song that celebrated Henry IV."}, {"question": "Who wrote the 'Henriade'?", "answer": "Voltaire wrote the 'Henriade'."}]}

During the Third Mithridatic War (73-63 BC) against Mithridates VI of Pontus and Tigranes the Great of Armenia, Metellus Celer was a lieutenant (legate) of Pompey during his eastern campaigns (66-63 BC).

Pompey had split his army into three divisions. Metellus Celer was in charge of one of them and custodian of Tigranes the Younger of Armenia. Metellus vigorously repulsed Oroeses while Flaccus and Pompey, who were in charge of the other two divisions, defeated the other Albanians.

He went to stay at the house of Metellus Celer to allay suspicions as Metellus was the praetor, but was unsuccessful.

He was sent to the district of Pisa (in Etruria) with three legions. On learning that the rebels were advancing towards Pistoia to flee to Cisalpine Gaul (in northern Italy) he encamped at the foot of the mountain from which they had to descend for their passage to Cisalpine Gaul, while the consul Antonius had his troops at their rear. He besieged Faesulae (Fiesole), the base of Catiline, together with Antonius. The two men were encamped in two different places. Catiline attacked Antonius instead of Metellus, even through the former had a larger army. References to Metellus Celer during the conspiracy were also made by Cicero and Valerius Maximus. When he was consul in 60 BC Metellus Celer sided with the Optimates and vigorously opposed Pompey in everything because he had divorced his sister. Together with Cato the Younger he was the main opponent of the ratification of the acts Pompey had made with the cities and kingdoms in Asia as a result of the Mithridatic War. He also opposed an agrarian bill proposed by Flavius, a plebeian tribune, which Pompey sponsored and which was intended to give land grants to Pompey's discharged soldiers which they were entitled to. Metellus led the opposition to the agrarian bill. He contested every point of Flavius' bill and attacked him so persistently that the plebeian tribune had him put in prison. Metellus wanted to convene the senate there and Flavius sat at the entrance of the cell to prevent this. Metellus had the wall cut through to let them in. When Pompey heard this he was afraid of the reaction of the people and told Flavius to desist. Metellus did not consent when the other plebeian tribunes wanted to set him free. In 59 BC Metellus Celer and Cato the Younger for a time refused to swear obedience to the agrarian law of Julius Caesar, who was consul in that year. Eventually they complied. During Metellus Celer’s praetorship, Titus Labienus indicted an old backbench Optimate senator, Gaius Rabirius, for the murder of Lucius Appuleius Saturninus thirty-six years earlier. Saturninus had been opposed by the consuls of the time at the direction of the senate. Thus, with the proposed trial the senate would lose the authority to enforce its decrees. Acts which had received the approval of the senate and had been committed many years earlier tended to give immunity to those who tried to repeat the conduct of Saturninus and make punishment of such acts ineffective. The senate was outraged that an innocent elderly man of senatorial rank was attacked and that the tribunes were entrusted with the control of affairs. There were pro- and anti-prosecution factions. The former won through the support of Julius Caesar, who was the judge together with Lucius Julius Caesar, and Rabirius was charged. The judges had been unlawfully chosen by the urban praetor, Lentulus Sura, instead of the people. Rabirius appealed and would have been convicted by the people, but this was prevented by Metellus by obstructing the meeting of the assembly of the people. Metellus Celer was married to his cousin Clodia Quadrantaria, often referred to in scholarship as Clodia Metelli (\"Clodia the wife of Metellus\"), the daughter of Appius Claudius Pulcher. They had a daughter named Caecilia Metella, like all the women in the family of the Caecilii Metelli. Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer died suddenly in 59 BC--according to some poisoned by his wife, who was notoriously debauched, reputed to be the incestuous lover of her brother Clodius, of Caelius, possibly of the great lyric poet Catullus (most authorities identify her as the subject of his \"Lesbia\"), and many others.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer?", "answer": "Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer was a consul in 60 BC and son of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos."}, {"question": "When was Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer born?", "answer": "The exact birth year of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer is not specified in the text."}, {"question": "What was the occupation of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer?", "answer": "Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer was a consul, praetor, and Augur."}, {"question": "Who was the father of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer?", "answer": "Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer's father was either Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos or Tribune Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer."}, {"question": "Who was the king of the Caucasian Albanians that attacked the forces of Pompey?", "answer": "The king of the Caucasian Albanians that attacked the forces of Pompey was Oroeses."}, {"question": "Who was the leader of the Catilinarian Conspiracy?", "answer": "The leader of the Catilinarian Conspiracy was Catiline."}, {"question": "Who was the consul in 60 BC that sided with the Optimates and opposed Pompey?", "answer": "Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer was the consul in 60 BC that sided with the Optimates and opposed Pompey."}, {"question": "Who was the main opponent of the ratification of the acts Pompey had made with the cities and kingdoms in Asia?", "answer": "Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer was the main opponent of the ratification of the acts Pompey had made with the cities and kingdoms in Asia."}, {"question": "Who was the plebeian tribune that proposed an agrarian bill?", "answer": "The plebeian tribune that proposed an agrarian bill was Flavius."}, {"question": "Who was the judge together with Lucius Julius Caesar in the trial of Gaius Rabirius?", "answer": "Julius Caesar was the judge together with Lucius Julius Caesar in the trial of Gaius Rabirius."}, {"question": "Who was the wife of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer?", "answer": "The wife of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer was Clodia Quadrantaria."}, {"question": "Who was the daughter of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer?", "answer": "The daughter of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer was Caecilia Metella."}, {"question": "How did Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer die?", "answer": "Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer died suddenly in 59 BC, possibly due to poisoning by his wife Clodia Quadrantaria."}]}

In 1719 he was appointed President of the Kommerskollegium, and in 1727 he became a Marshal. Magnus Julius De la Gardie was a vocal friend of the French kingdom. When the Riksdag of the Estates was summoned in 1734, he proposed closer ties between Sweden and France.

{"title": "Pontus De la Gardie", "passage": "Baron Pontus De la Gardie (ca. 1520 – 5 November 1585) was a French nobleman and general in the service of Denmark and Sweden. He was born Ponce d'Escouperie in Caunes-Minervois (Aude), Languedoc, a son of Jacques Escoperier and X Armengaud. As a youngster, he wanted to become a priest and was educated in a monastery. He changed his mind however, and left Languedoc to become a mercenary in the service of Denmark. De la Gardie was promoted to officer and was in charge of a regiment of mercenaries. In 1565, during the Northern Seven Years' War, he was captured by Swedish troops at Varberg, and changed allegiance to Sweden. De la Gardie quickly became a favourite of John III of Sweden and in 1569, after only four years in the Swedish service, he received noble status. In 1571, he was created a baron and was given Ekholmen Castle. He was suspected to have taken part in a plot to assassinate John III. The plot was led by Charles de Mornay, who was in contact with Christina of Denmark and the French ambassador in Copenhagen Charles Dancay. John III was to be killed during a swords dance performed by Scottish mercenaries at the party which was to be given in October that year before the Scottish mercenaries departure to the Baltic. After the assassination, the king's brother Duke Charles was to be placed upon the throne. The plot did not materialize as de Mornay lost his nerve and never gave the sign to the mercenaries to take action. In September 1574, the plot was revealed and Charles de Mornay was arrested, interrogated and executed. It was never made clear who participated in the plot. However, it is noted, that the suspected conspirators Hogenskild Bielke, Gustaf Banér and Pontus De la Gardie, often gathered at meetings in the apartment of Princess Elizabeth of Sweden, meetings where Princess Cecilia of Sweden had also frequently been seen, and the two sisters and their brother Charles were somewhat compromised though they were never accused. Pontus De la Gardie was himself never put on trial for his suspected involvement in the affair. After Clas Åkesson Tott's resignation as the supreme commander of the Swedish forces in Finland and Estonia as a consequence of the Siege of Wesenberg (1574) during the Livonian War, de la Gardie took over Tott's office. De la Gardie's skills combined with the fact that Sweden's enemy Russia had to transfer troops to defend against Polish attacks further south led to considerable military success for Sweden during the following years. In the fall of 1580, Karelia was conquered. De la Gardie led his troops over the frozen Gulf of Finland to capture the fortresses of Wesenberg (now Rakvere) and Tolsburg (now Toolse). In September 1581, Narva was taken after a storming that had been preceded by a massive bombardment. 4,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, pointing out the fact that De la Gardie was not only a skillful warrior, but a cruel and hard commander as well. De la Gardie and his Swedish troops went on to capture the fortress of Ivangorod and several other fortresses that autumn. In 1582, the war with Russia was ended and Sweden got to keep the conquests made in Karelia and Ingria, but had to withdraw from Livonia. De la Gardie was the most renowned military commander in Sweden during the 16th century and has been credited with much of the country's military success in the 1580s. An example of his ingenuity was the strategy of using zigzag shaped saps during the siege of Narva, a new technique at the time. De la Gardie drowned in the Narva River and is buried in St Mary's Cathedral of Tallinn.

{"title": "Jack Clayton", "passage": "Jack Clayton (1 March 1921 – 26 February 1995) was a British film director and producer who specialised in bringing literary works to the screen. Starting out as a teenage studio \"tea boy\" in 1935, Clayton worked his way up through British film industry in a career that spanned nearly sixty years. He rapidly rose through a series of increasingly important roles in British film production, before shooting to international prominence as a director with his Oscar-winning feature film debut, the drama \"Room at the Top\" (1959); this was followed by the much-lauded horror film \"The Innocents\" (1961), adapted from Henry James' \"The Turn of the Screw\". Clayton looked set for a brilliant future, and he was highly regarded by peers and critics alike, but a number of overlapping factors hampered his career. He was a notably 'choosy' director, who by his own admission \"never made a film I didn't want to make\", and he repeatedly turned down films (including \"Alien\") that became huge hits for other directors. But he was also dogged by bad luck and bad timing - the Hollywood studios labelled him as 'difficult', and studio politics quashed a string of planned films in the 1970s, which were either taken out of his hands, or cancelled in the final stages of preparation. In 1977, he suffered a double blow - his current film was cancelled just two weeks before shooting was due to begin, and a few months later he suffered a serious stroke which robbed him of the ability to speak, and put his career on hold for five years. Despite his relatively small \"oeuvre\", the films of Jack Clayton continue to be appreciated, and both they and their director have been widely admired and praised by leading film critics like Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert, and by film industry peers including Harold Pinter, Martin Scorsese, Guillermo del Toro, François Truffaut, Tennessee Williams and Steven Spielberg.", "qa": [{"question": "Who is the subject of the text?", "answer": "Jack Clayton"}, {"question": "When was Jack Clayton born?", "answer": "Jack Clayton was born on 1 March 1921"}, {"question": "Where did Jack Clayton start his career in the film industry?", "answer": "Jack Clayton started his career in the film industry as a teenage studio 'tea boy' in 1935"}, {"question": "What was Jack Clayton's Oscar-winning feature film debut?", "answer": "Jack Clayton's Oscar-winning feature film debut was the drama 'Room at the Top' (1959)"}, {"question": "What is the title of the horror film directed by Jack Clayton?", "answer": "The title of the horror film directed by Jack Clayton is 'The Innocents' (1961)"}, {"question": "What is the name of the literary work adapted into the film 'The Innocents'?", "answer": "The literary work adapted into the film 'The Innocents' is 'The Turn of the Screw' by Henry James"}, {"question": "Why did Jack Clayton's career suffer a setback?", "answer": "Jack Clayton's career suffered a setback due to bad luck and bad timing, including the cancellation of a film and a serious stroke"}, {"question": "Who are some notable film critics who have praised Jack Clayton's work?", "answer": "Notable film critics who have praised Jack Clayton's work include Pauline Kael, Roger Ebert, Harold Pinter, Martin Scorsese, Guillermo del Toro, François Truffaut, Tennessee Williams, and Steven Spielberg"}]}

He was one of the first six British prisoners of war to arrive at Oflag IV- C, Colditz, in 1940. He made and assisted in numerous escape attempts, working with the chairman of the escape committee, Pat Reid, and was still at the castle when it was liberated by the US Army in April 1945. He was the honorary secretary of the Colditz Association for 50 years. Lockwood was born in London, the son of a jobber at the London Stock Exchange. He was educated at Whitgift School in Croydon, and then worked for his father's firm in the City of London. He joined the Territorial Army's 22nd( County of London) Battalion of the London Regiment( The Queen's Royal West Surreys) in 1933. He was mobilized in August 1939 and trained at Yeovil before being posted to Le Mans, commanding a company of the 1st/ 6th Battalion of the Queen's Royal Regiment. After marching with his unit to Belgium, he was captured in the retreat to Dunkirk in May 1940. He was sent to Oflag VII- C, at Laufen Castle. With six other prisoners, including Pat Reid, he dug a tunnel to escape, thought to be the first escape from a German prisoner of war camp in the Second World War. They escaped in two groups of three, with Reid leading the first group and Lockwood in the second group with Captain Harry Elliott of the Irish Guards and Captain Dick Howe of the Royal Tank Regiment.

{"title": "Gus Van Sant", "passage": "Gus Green Van Sant Jr. (born July 24, 1952) is an American film director, screenwriter, painter, photographer, musician, and author who has earned acclaim as both an independent and mainstream filmmaker. His films typically deal with themes of marginalized subcultures, in particular homosexuality; as such, Van Sant is considered one of the most prominent auteurs of the New Queer Cinema movement. Van Sant's early career was devoted to directing television commercials in the Pacific Northwest. He made his feature-length cinematic directorial debut with \"Mala Noche\" (1985). His second feature \"Drugstore Cowboy\" (1989) was highly acclaimed, and earned Van Sant screenwriting awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and New York Film Critics Circle and the award for Best Director from the National Society of Film Critics. His following film, \"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991), was similarly praised, as was the black comedy \"To Die For\" (1995), the drama \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997), and the biographical film \"Milk\" (2008); for the latter two, Van Sant was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director and both films received Best Picture nominations. In 2003, Van Sant's film about the Columbine High School massacre, \"Elephant\", won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Van Sant also received the festival's Best Director Award that same year, making him one of only two filmmakers—the other being Joel Coen—to win both accolades at the festival in the same year. Though most of Van Sant's other films received favourable reviews, such as \"Finding Forrester\" (2000) and \"Paranoid Park\" (2007), some of his efforts, such as the art house production \"Last Days\" (2005) and the environmental drama \"Promised Land\" (2012), have received more mixed reviews from critics, while his adaptation of Tom Robbins's \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" (1994), his 1998 remake of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\", and \"The Sea of Trees\" (2015), were critical and commercial failures.

{"title": "My Own Private Idaho", "passage": "My Own Private Idaho is a 1991 American independent adventure drama film written and directed by Gus Van Sant, loosely based on Shakespeare's\" Henry IV, Part 1 Henry IV, Part 2\", and\" Henry V\", and starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves. The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland, Oregon to Mike's hometown in Idaho, and then to Rome in search of Mike's mother. Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechy's 1963 novel\" City of Night\" and concluding that Rechy's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott's story as a modern update of the\" Henry IV\" plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. After he sent copies of his script to Reeves, and Reeves then showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film on each other's behalf. \" My Own Private Idaho\" had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of\" The New York Times\" and\" Entertainment Weekly\". The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over$ 6.4 million in North America, above its estimated budget of$ 2.5 million. Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards, and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics. \" My Own Private Idaho\" is considered a landmark film in the New Queer Cinema movement, an early 1990s movement in queer- themed independent filmmaking. Since its 1991 release, the film has grown in popularity and been deemed as a cult classic, especially among LGBT audiences.

{"title": "Elmer Clifton", "passage": "Elmer Clifton( March 14, 1890 – October 15, 1949) was an American writer, director and actor from the early silent days. A collaborator of D.W. Griffith, he appeared in\" The Birth of a Nation\"( 1915) and\" Intolerance\"( 1916) before giving up acting in 1917 to concentrate on work behind the camera, with Griffith and Joseph Henabery as his mentors. His first feature- length solo effort as a director was\" The Flame of Youth\" with Jack Mulhall. Clifton honed his talents during the late 1910s, directing vehicles for Mulhall and Herbert Rawlinson at Universal and then for Dorothy Gish for Famous Players- Lasky. Two of his projects with Gish,\" Nobody Home\" and\" Nugget Nell\", featured performances from pre-stardom Rudolph Valentino. Most of this early output has been lost. He was the first filmmaker to discover the talents of Clara Bow, whom he cast in\" Down to the Sea in Ships\", released on March 4, 1923. The independently produced film was well reviewed for its visual authenticity. During the 1920s, Clifton directed films for several different studios. During the filming of\" The Warrens of Virginia\"( 1924) for Fox Film Corporation, lead actress Martha Mansfield suffered a fatal accident from burns when her costume caught fire. Clifton directed\" The Wreck of the Hesperus\" for Cecil B. deMille's production company, and filmed on location in the Grand Canyon for\" The Bride of the Colorado\". He also directed some Technicolor short films, including\" Manchu Love\" with an all- Asian cast. In the sound era, Clifton wrote and directed many poverty row Westerns and\" exploitation\" classics, among them the anti-marijuana polemic\" Assassin of Youth\"( 1937). He also directed the vice films\" Gambling with Souls\"( 1936),\" Slaves in Bondage\"( 1937) and\" City of Missing Girls\"( 1941), all of which portrayed addiction and white slavery to some degree.

He directed a version of\" The Unknown Soldier\" in 1985, 30 years after Edvin Laine directed the original version of it. Mollberg's movie's plot was same as Laine's movie. But Mollberg used unknown actors and the movie was colourised and shot by a handhold camera. Mollberg did not begin directing films for the cinema until he was well into his forties. He made a notable splash on the international festival circuit in 1974 with\" The Earth Is A Sinful Song\"( 1973), his debut feature, an earthy, erotically- charged, blood- soaked tale of a young village girl's ill- fated affair with a Lapp reindeer herdsman. Based on a novel by the late Timo K. Mukka, one of Finland's most controversial young writers, the film\" stunned Scandinavian critics and audiences alike with its simple, terrible power and its authentic sensuality\"( Peter Cowie), and went on to become one of the biggest box- office successes in the Finnish cinema's history. It also introduced Mollberg's trademark style:\" a realistic naturalism full of expressive force with which he merges the people with the scenery, stripping them bare of life's illusions and the polished veneer of culture\"( Sakari Toiviainen). Despite Peter Cowie's efforts, and the acclaim of many other critics and\" independent\" festivals, The Finnish National Film board has stubbornly sequestered this masterpiece, only releasing it in a DVD format incompatible with international viewing, and lacking English subtitles.

{"title": "Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor", "passage": "Henry IV (11 November 1050 – 7 August 1106) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1084 to 1105, king of Germany from 1054 to 1105, king of Italy and Burgundy from 1056 to 1105, and duke of Bavaria from 1052 to 1054. He was the son of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, and Agnes of Poitou. After his father's death on 5 October 1056, Henry was placed under his mother's guardianship. She made grants to German aristocrats to secure their support. Unlike her late husband, she could not control the election of the popes, thus the idea of the \"freedom of the church\" strengthened during her rule. Taking advantage of her weakness, Archbishop Anno II of Cologne kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of age in 1065. Henry decided to recover the royal estates that had been lost during his minority. He employed low-ranking officials to carry out his new policies, causing discontent in Saxony and Thuringia. Henry crushed a riot in Saxony in 1069 and overcame the rebellion of the Saxon aristocrat, Otto of Nordheim in 1071. The appointment of commoners to high offices offended German aristocrats, and many of them withdrew from Henry's court. He insisted on his royal prerogatives relating to the appointment of bishops and abbots, although the reformist clerics condemned this practice as simony (a forbidden sale of church offices). Pope Alexander II blamed Henry's advisors for his acts and excommunicated them in early 1073. Henry's conflicts with the Holy See and the German dukes weakened his position and the Saxons rose up again in the summer of 1074. He took advantage of a rift between the Saxon aristocrats and peasantry and forced the rebels into submission in October 1075. Henry adopted an active policy in Italy, alarming Pope Gregory VII who threatened him with excommunication for simony. Henry persuaded most of the German bishops to declare the Pope's election invalid on 24 January 1076. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects of allegiance. To prevent the Pope from sitting in judgement on him at the German leaders' assembly, Henry went to Italy. His penitential \"Walk to Canossa\" was a success. Gregory VII had no choice but to absolve him in January 1077. Henry's German opponents ignored his absolution and elected an antiking, Rudolf of Rheinfelden, on 14 March 1077. The Pope was initially neutral in the two kings' conflict, enabling Henry to consolidate his position. Henry continued to appoint high-ranking clerics, for which the Pope again excommunicated him on 7 March 1080. Most German and Lombardian bishops remained loyal to Henry and they elected an antipope, Clement III. Rudolf of Rheinfelden was killed in battle and his successor, Hermann of Salm, could only exert royal authority in Saxony. From 1081, Henry launched a series of military campaigns to Italy, and Clement III crowned him emperor in Rome on 1 April 1084. Hermann of Salm died and Henry pacified Saxony with the local aristocrats' assistance in 1088. He launched an invasion against the pope's principal Italian ally, Matilda of Tuscany, in 1089. She convinced Henry's elder son, Conrad, to take up arms against his father in 1093. Her alliance with Welf I, Duke of Bavaria prevented Henry's return to Germany until 1096 when he was reconciled with Welf. After Clement III's death, Henry did not support new antipopes, but he did not make peace with Pope Paschal II. Henry proclaimed the first \"Landfrieden\" (or imperial peace) which covered the whole territory of Germany in 1103. His younger son, Henry V, forced him to abdicate on 31 December 1105. He tried to regain his throne with the assistance of Lotharingian aristocrats, but became ill and died without receiving absolution from his excommunication.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was the Holy Roman Emperor from 1084 to 1105?", "answer": "Henry IV was the Holy Roman Emperor from 1084 to 1105."}, {"question": "When did Henry IV become king of Germany?", "answer": "Henry IV became king of Germany from 1054 to 1105."}, {"question": "What was the name of Henry IV's mother?", "answer": "Agnes of Poitou was the name of Henry IV's mother."}, {"question": "Who kidnapped Henry IV in April 1062?", "answer": "Archbishop Anno II of Cologne kidnapped Henry IV in April 1062."}, {"question": "What was the name of the rebellion led by the Saxon aristocrat, Otto of Nordheim in 1071?", "answer": "The name of the rebellion led by the Saxon aristocrat, Otto of Nordheim in 1071 was not mentioned in the text."}, {"question": "What was the practice condemned by the reformist clerics as simony?", "answer": "The practice of selling church offices was condemned by the reformist clerics as simony."}, {"question": "Who excommunicated Henry IV's advisors in early 1073?", "answer": "Pope Alexander II blamed Henry IV's advisors for his acts and excommunicated them in early 1073."}, {"question": "What was the name of the Pope who threatened Henry IV with excommunication for simony?", "answer": "Pope Gregory VII was the name of the Pope who threatened Henry IV with excommunication for simony."}, {"question": "What was the name of the event where Henry IV walked to Canossa?", "answer": "The name of the event where Henry IV walked to Canossa was not mentioned in the text."}, {"question": "Who was the antiking elected on 14 March 1077?", "answer": "Rudolf of Rheinfelden was the antiking elected on 14 March 1077."}, {"question": "Who was the antipope elected by the German and Lombardian bishops?", "answer": "Clement III was the antipope elected by the German and Lombardian bishops."}, {"question": "Who was the Duke of Bavaria who prevented Henry IV's return to Germany until 1096?", "answer": "Welf I, Duke of Bavaria was the Duke of Bavaria who prevented Henry IV's return to Germany until 1096."}, {"question": "What was the name of the first 'Landfrieden' proclaimed by Henry IV?", "answer": "The name of the first 'Landfrieden' proclaimed by Henry IV was not mentioned in the text."}, {"question": "Who forced Henry IV to abdicate on 31 December 1105?", "answer": "Henry IV's younger son, Henry V, forced him to abdicate on 31 December 1105."}]}

Upon the death of his brother, Count Adolf VIII of Berg, William succeeded as Count of Berg. Formerly serving as a monk, he was absolved of his religious vows by the pope in order to take the position. His tenure was notable due to increased and constant conflict with the Archbishop of Cologne. In 1300 he supported King Albert I of Germany against the Rhenish electors which further strengthened his position against the archbishop. During his life he started foundations for monasteries and churches, including those in Beyenburg( now part of Wuppertal) and Gräfrath.

{"title": "Lev Shcherba", "passage": "Lev Shcherba( commonly Scherba)( Russian: Лев Влади́мирови ч Ще́рба, Belarusian: Леў Уладзіміравіч Шчэрба)( – December 26, 1944) was a Russian linguist and lexicographer specializing in phonetics and phonology. Born in Igumen( Minsk Governorate, Russian Empire, now Chervyen, Belarus) to the family of an engineer. Shcherba went to high school in Kiev, graduating in 1898, and briefly attended Kiev University before moving to the capital and entering St. Petersburg University. There he studied under Jan Baudouin de Courtenay, graduating in 1903. In 1906 he traveled abroad, first to Leipzig and then to northern Italy, where he studied Tuscan dialects. During the autumn holidays of 1907 and 1908, on the advice of Baudouin de Courtenay, he studied the Sorbian languages, writing a description of the Mužakow dialect( spoken in the east, near Muskau). At the end of 1907 he went to Paris, where he worked in the experimental phonetics laboratory of Jean- Pierre Rousselot studying the phonetics of a series of languages using experimental methods; on his return to Russia he began setting up an experimental phonetics laboratory, paying for equipment from his own stipend, and this became the institution that now bears his name. As early as 1912, basing himself on the ideas of Baudouin de Courtenay, he elaborated the concept of the phoneme, defined by him as the grouping of sounds into\" sound types\". In 1912 he defended his master's thesis and in 1915 received his doctorate from St. Petersburg University, where he was a professor from 1916 to 1941. He became the founder of the so- called\" Leningrad school\" of phonology, which included M. I. Matusevich and L. R. Zinder among others and carried on a polemic with the\" Moscow school.\" However, he spent the last few years of his life in Moscow, where he died. He became an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1943. Beyond phonology, Shcherba made significant contributions to the wider fields of linguistics and lexicography. In contrast to Ferdinand de Saussure, he recognized three rather than two objects of study: speech activity, language systems, and language material. He placed emphasis on the question of the capacity of the speaker to produce sentences never previously heard, a question which would become important to the linguistics of the later twentieth century. He also emphasized the importance of experiments in linguistics, particularly that of negative results, developing methods which became important for field study. He was the teacher of the lexicographer Sergei Ozhegov, author of the most widely used Russian dictionary. Shcherba is the author of the\" glokaya kuzdra\" sentence, which consists of words whose roots do not exist in Russian, but has correct construction in terms of Russian morphology and syntax — similar to Chomsky's\" Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\". He invented this sentence to illustrate the distinction between grammar and vocabulary.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was Lev Shcherba?", "answer": "Lev Shcherba was a Russian linguist and lexicographer specializing in phonetics and phonology."}, {"question": "When was Lev Shcherba born and when did he die?", "answer": "Lev Shcherba was born on an unknown date and died on December 26, 1944."}, {"question": "Where was Lev Shcherba born?", "answer": "Lev Shcherba was born in Igumen, Minsk Governorate, Russian Empire, now Chervyen, Belarus."}, {"question": "What was Lev Shcherba's family background?", "answer": "Lev Shcherba was born to the family of an engineer."}, {"question": "Where did Lev Shcherba go to high school and when did he graduate?", "answer": "Lev Shcherba went to high school in Kiev, graduating in 1898."}, {"question": "Which universities did Lev Shcherba attend?", "answer": "Lev Shcherba briefly attended Kiev University and then entered St. Petersburg University."}, {"question": "Who did Lev Shcherba study under at St. Petersburg University?", "answer": "Lev Shcherba studied under Jan Baudouin de Courtenay at St. Petersburg University."}, {"question": "When did Lev Shcherba graduate from St. Petersburg University?", "answer": "Lev Shcherba graduated from St. Petersburg University in 1903."}, {"question": "Where did Lev Shcherba travel in 1906?", "answer": "In 1906, Lev Shcherba traveled to Leipzig and then to northern Italy."}, {"question": "What did Lev Shcherba study in northern Italy?", "answer": "In northern Italy, Lev Shcherba studied Tuscan dialects."}, {"question": "When did Lev Shcherba study the Sorbian languages?", "answer": "Lev Shcherba studied the Sorbian languages during the autumn holidays of 1907 and 1908."}, {"question": "What did Lev Shcherba write about the Sorbian languages?", "answer": "Lev Shcherba wrote a description of the Mužakow dialect of the Sorbian languages."}, {"question": "Where did Lev Shcherba work in Paris?", "answer": "In Paris, Lev Shcherba worked in the experimental phonetics laboratory of Jean-Pierre Rousselot."}, {"question": "What did Lev Shcherba do after returning to Russia?", "answer": "After returning to Russia, Lev Shcherba began setting up an experimental phonetics laboratory, paying for equipment from his own stipend."}, {"question": "What concept did Lev Shcherba elaborate in 1912?", "answer": "In 1912, Lev Shcherba elaborated the concept of the phoneme, defined as the grouping of sounds into \"sound types\"."}, {"question": "When did Lev Shcherba defend his master's thesis and receive his doctorate?", "answer": "Lev Shcherba defended his master's thesis in 1912 and received his doctorate in 1915 from St. Petersburg University."}, {"question": "What position did Lev Shcherba hold at St. Petersburg University and for how long?", "answer": "Lev Shcherba was a professor at St. Petersburg University from 1916 to 1941."}, {"question": "What school of phonology did Lev Shcherba found?", "answer": "Lev Shcherba founded the \"Leningrad school\" of phonology."}, {"question": "Who were some members of the Leningrad school of phonology?", "answer": "The Leningrad school included M.

Beresford was the second son of John Beresford, 4th Marquess of Waterford, thus despite his courtesy title as the younger son of a Marquess, he was still eligible to enter the House of Commons. He combined the two careers of the navy and a member of parliament, making a reputation as a hero in battle and champion of the navy in the House of Commons. He was a well- known and popular figure who courted publicity, widely known to the British public as\" Charlie B\". He was considered by many to be a personification of John Bull, indeed was normally accompanied by his trademark, a bulldog. His later career was marked by a longstanding dispute with Admiral of the Fleet Sir John Fisher, over reforms championed by Fisher introducing new technology and sweeping away traditional practices. Fisher, slightly senior to Beresford and more successful, became a barrier to Beresford's rise to the highest office in the navy.

{"title": "The Devil in Miss Jones", "passage": "The Devil in Miss Jones is a 1973 pornographic film, written, directed and produced by Gerard Damiano and starring Georgina Spelvin and Harry Reems. It is widely regarded as a classic adult film, released during the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984). After his 1972 success with \"Deep Throat\", Damiano shot the film in a converted apple-packing plant in Milanville, Pennsylvania. Along with \"Deep Throat\" and \"Behind the Green Door\", the film is associated with a time in American culture known as \"porno chic\", in which adult erotic films were just beginning to be widely released, publicly discussed by celebrities (like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope) and taken seriously by film critics (like Roger Ebert). The film's plot was inspired by the 1944 play \"No Exit\" by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. \" The Devil in Miss Jones\" went on to spawn numerous remakes and sequels. As with many films of the Golden Age of Porn, the copyright status of \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" is unresolved. VCX claims a copyright; rival distributor Arrow Productions distributed unauthorized copies of the film for a time before 2009, when (as part of a mutual truce between the companies) Arrow agreed to accept VCX's copyright claim in exchange for not challenging Arrow's copyright claim on \"Deep Throat\".", "qa": [{"question": "What is The Devil in Miss Jones?", "answer": "The Devil in Miss Jones is a 1973 pornographic film."}, {"question": "Who wrote, directed, and produced The Devil in Miss Jones?", "answer": "The Devil in Miss Jones was written, directed, and produced by Gerard Damiano."}, {"question": "Who stars in The Devil in Miss Jones?", "answer": "The Devil in Miss Jones stars Georgina Spelvin and Harry Reems."}, {"question": "How is The Devil in Miss Jones regarded?", "answer": "The Devil in Miss Jones is widely regarded as a classic adult film."}, {"question": "When was The Devil in Miss Jones released?", "answer": "The Devil in Miss Jones was released during the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984)."}, {"question": "What was Gerard Damiano's previous success before The Devil in Miss Jones?", "answer": "Gerard Damiano had success with \"Deep Throat\" in 1972."}, {"question": "Where was The Devil in Miss Jones shot?", "answer": "The Devil in Miss Jones was shot in a converted apple-packing plant in Milanville, Pennsylvania."}, {"question": "What other films is The Devil in Miss Jones associated with?", "answer": "The Devil in Miss Jones is associated with \"Deep Throat\" and \"Behind the Green Door\"."}, {"question": "What cultural period is The Devil in Miss Jones associated with?", "answer": "The film is associated with a time in American culture known as \"porno chic\"."}, {"question": "What happened during the \"porno chic\" period?", "answer": "During \"porno chic\", adult erotic films were widely released, discussed by celebrities, and taken seriously by film critics."}, {"question": "Which celebrities discussed adult films during \"porno chic\"?", "answer": "Celebrities like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope discussed adult films."}, {"question": "Which film critic took adult films seriously?", "answer": "Film critic Roger Ebert took adult films seriously."}, {"question": "What inspired the plot of The Devil in Miss Jones?", "answer": "The plot was inspired by the 1944 play \"No Exit\" by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre."}, {"question": "What did The Devil in Miss Jones spawn?", "answer": "The Devil in Miss Jones spawned numerous remakes and sequels."}, {"question": "What is the copyright status of The Devil in Miss Jones?", "answer": "The copyright status of The Devil in Miss Jones is unresolved."}, {"question": "Which company claims copyright on The Devil in Miss Jones?", "answer": "VCX claims a copyright on The Devil in Miss Jones."}, {"question": "What did Arrow Productions do regarding The Devil in Miss Jones?", "answer": "Arrow Productions distributed unauthorized copies of the film for a time before 2009."}, {"question": "What agreement was made between VCX and Arrow Productions in 2009?", "answer": "In 2009, Arrow agreed to accept VCX's copyright claim in exchange for not challenging Arrow's copyright claim on \"Deep Throat\"."}]}
