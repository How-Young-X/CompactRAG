He declared himself as an opponent to the president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and a candidate to his succession. Mekki was one of the few political opponents calling for an immediate end to the Ben Ali regime, and his prosecution for corruption and torture. Mekki was born in Tunis. he embraced many of Tunisia's first president Habib Bourguiba's foreign policies which called for a pragmatic solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and closer ties with Western countries. He presented himself as moderate and quickly distanced himself from other political opponents including Islamists. After 12 June 2007, Mekki posted his speeches online revealing the foundation of his presidential programme. He called for the birth of a \"Second Tunisian republic\" where rights would be guaranteed to all Tunisians. According to him, this was the only alternative to the then existing regime. Mekki claimed that women had been wearing veils as a mean of silent political protests rather than true religious conviction. Mekki proposed to fight the \"real\" roots of Islamic Terrorism and blamed President Ben Ali's policies for the rise of extremists. This could also just have been a ploy to gain support in the West, as Ben Ali had similarly proclaimed to be fighting terrorism. Mekki's team produced a series of political comic sketches called \"Mille et une nuits\" (engl. \" One Thousand and One Nights or Elf Leila w Leila\") in which he ridiculed President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, his wife Leila Trabelsi-Ben Ali, and the Trabelsi family – the name of the sketches themselves a jab at the president's wife.

{"title": "International relations theory", "passage": "International relations theory is the study of international relations( IR) from a theoretical perspective. It attempts to provide a conceptual framework upon which international relations can be analyzed. Ole Holsti describes international relations theories as acting like pairs of coloured sunglasses that allow the wearer to see only salient events relevant to the theory; e.g., an adherent of realism may completely disregard an event that a constructivist might pounce upon as crucial, and vice versa. The three most prominent theories are realism, liberalism and constructivism. Sometimes, institutionalism proposed and developed by Keohane and Nye is discussed as a paradigm differed from liberalism. International relations theories can be divided into\" positivist/ rationalist\" theories which focus on a principally state- level analysis, and\" post-positivist/ reflectivist\" ones which incorporate expanded meanings of security, ranging from class, to gender, to postcolonial security. Many often conflicting ways of thinking exist in IR theory, including constructivism, institutionalism, Marxism, neo- Gramscianism, and others. However, two positivist schools of thought are most prevalent: realism and liberalism. The study of international relations, as theory, can be traced to E. H. Carr's\" The Twenty Years' Crisis\", which was published in 1939, and to Hans Morgenthau's\" Politics Among Nations\" published in 1948. International relations, as a discipline, is believed to have emerged after the First World War with the establishment of a Chair of International Relations at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. Early international relations scholarship in the interwar years focused on the need for the balance of power system to be replaced with a system of collective security. These thinkers were later described as\" Idealists\". The leading critique of this school of thinking was the\" realist\" analysis offered by Carr. However, a more recent study, by David Long and Brian Schmidt in 2005, offers a revisionist account of the origins of the field of international relations. They claim that the history of the field can be traced back to late 19th Century imperialism and internationalism. The fact that the history of the field is presented by\" great debates\", such as the realist- idealist debate, does not correspond with the historic evidence found in earlier works: \" We should once and for all dispense with the outdated anachronistic artifice of the debate between the idealists and realists as the dominant framework for and understanding the history of the field\". Their revisionist account claims that, up until 1918, international relations already existed in the form of colonial administration, race science, and race development.

Ben Ali was subsequently reelected with enormous majorities, each time exceeding 90% of the vote; his final re-election coming on 25 October 2009. On 14 January 2011, following a month of protests against his rule, he was forced to flee to Saudi Arabia along with his wife Leïla Ben Ali and their three children. The interim Tunisian government asked Interpol to issue an international arrest warrant, charging him with money laundering and drug trafficking. A Tunisian court sentenced Ben Ali and his wife \"in absentia\" to 35 years in prison on 20 June 2011 on charges of theft and unlawful possession of cash and jewellery, of which were put up for auction. In June 2012, a Tunisian court sentenced him \"in absentia\" to life imprisonment for inciting violence and murder and another life sentence by a military court on April 2013 for violent repression of protests in Sfax.

Hoping to reach a wide audience, the director forsook his usual practice of emphasizing groups by concentrating on a single rural heroine. Eisenstein briefly abandoned this project to film , in honour of the 10th anniversary of the Revolution. By the time he was able to return to this film, the Party's attitudes had changed and Trotsky had fallen from grace. As a result, the film was hastily re-edited and sent out in 1929 under a new title, \"The Old and the New\". In later years, archivists restored \"The General Line\" to an approximation of Eisenstein's original concept. Much of the director's montage-like imagery—such as using simple props to trace the progress from the agrarian customs of the 19th-century to the more mechanized procedures of the 20th—was common to both versions of the film.", "qa": [{"question": "What is the alternative title of 'The General Line'?", "answer": "'The General Line' is also known as 'Old and New'."}, {"question": "When was the film 'The General Line' released?", "answer": "'The General Line' was released in 1929."}, {"question": "Who directed the film 'The General Line'?", "answer": "The film 'The General Line' was directed by Sergei Eisenstein and Grigori Aleksandrov."}, {"question": "What was the initial purpose of the film 'The General Line'?", "answer": "The initial purpose of the film 'The General Line' was to celebrate the collectivization of agriculture."}, {"question": "Which Bolshevik leader's ideas were championed in 'The General Line'?", "answer": "The ideas of old-line Bolshevik Leon Trotsky were championed in 'The General Line'."}, {"question": "How did Sergei Eisenstein alter his usual filming style for 'The General Line'?", "answer": "Sergei Eisenstein altered his usual filming style for 'The General Line' by concentrating on a single rural heroine, rather than emphasizing groups."}, {"question": "What caused Eisenstein to abandon 'The General Line' temporarily?", "answer": "Eisenstein abandoned 'The General Line' temporarily to film a different project in honor of the 10th anniversary of the Revolution."}, {"question": "What change occurred in the Party's attitudes while Eisenstein was away from 'The General Line'?", "answer": "While Eisenstein was away from 'The General Line', the Party's attitudes changed and Leon Trotsky had fallen from grace."}, {"question": "What new title was given to 'The General Line' when it was re-edited in 1929?", "answer": "When 'The General Line' was re-edited in 1929, it was given the new title 'The Old and the New'."}, {"question": "What efforts were made to restore 'The General Line' in later years?", "answer": "In later years, archivists restored 'The General Line' to an approximation of Eisenstein's original concept."}, {"question": "What type of imagery was common to both versions of 'The General Line'?", "answer": "Both versions of 'The General Line' featured montage-like imagery, such as using simple props to trace the progress from agrarian customs to mechanized procedures."}, {"question": "What was the main focus of the imagery in 'The General Line'?", "answer": "The main focus of the imagery in 'The General Line' was to trace the progress from 19th-century agrarian customs to 20th-century mechanized procedures."}]}

He served as master of the royal stables, as royal bailiff in Berry and as seneschal of Limousin. In 1454 he was appointed a Marshal of France. Jean Poton was a leading figure on the French side in the Hundred Years War. He fought at the battle of Verneuil in 1424. His participation, along with Joan of Arc, in the battle at Orléans in 1427 led to the end of the Siege of Orléans. He was badly wounded during this battle. He was captured at the battle of Cravant and later exchanged for John Talbot. Jean Poton fought numerous battles alongside Joan of Arc during the Loire Campaign. He remained a lifelong support for Joan of Arc. With La Hire, he even tried, albeit in vain, to rescue Joan after she was captured. Believing Joan was being held captive in Compiègne, Jean Poton captured it, only to learn that the prisoner had already been moved to Rouen. He served with Joan of Arc at the Siege of Orléans, and the battles of Jargeau, Meung- sur- Loire, Beaugency and Patay. He raised the siege of Compiègne.

{"title": "Lev Shcherba", "passage": "Lev Shcherba( commonly Scherba)( Russian: Лев Влади́мирови ч Ще́рба, Belarusian: Леў Уладзіміравіч Шчэрба)( – December 26, 1944) was a Russian linguist and lexicographer specializing in phonetics and phonology. Born in Igumen( Minsk Governorate, Russian Empire, now Chervyen, Belarus) to the family of an engineer. Shcherba went to high school in Kiev, graduating in 1898, and briefly attended Kiev University before moving to the capital and entering St. Petersburg University. There he studied under Jan Baudouin de Courtenay, graduating in 1903. In 1906 he traveled abroad, first to Leipzig and then to northern Italy, where he studied Tuscan dialects. During the autumn holidays of 1907 and 1908, on the advice of Baudouin de Courtenay, he studied the Sorbian languages, writing a description of the Mužakow dialect( spoken in the east, near Muskau). At the end of 1907 he went to Paris, where he worked in the experimental phonetics laboratory of Jean- Pierre Rousselot studying the phonetics of a series of languages using experimental methods; on his return to Russia he began setting up an experimental phonetics laboratory, paying for equipment from his own stipend, and this became the institution that now bears his name. As early as 1912, basing himself on the ideas of Baudouin de Courtenay, he elaborated the concept of the phoneme, defined by him as the grouping of sounds into\" sound types\". In 1912 he defended his master's thesis and in 1915 received his doctorate from St. Petersburg University, where he was a professor from 1916 to 1941. He became the founder of the so- called\" Leningrad school\" of phonology, which included M. I. Matusevich and L. R. Zinder among others and carried on a polemic with the\" Moscow school.\" However, he spent the last few years of his life in Moscow, where he died. He became an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1943. Beyond phonology, Shcherba made significant contributions to the wider fields of linguistics and lexicography. In contrast to Ferdinand de Saussure, he recognized three rather than two objects of study: speech activity, language systems, and language material. He placed emphasis on the question of the capacity of the speaker to produce sentences never previously heard, a question which would become important to the linguistics of the later twentieth century. He also emphasized the importance of experiments in linguistics, particularly that of negative results, developing methods which became important for field study.

{"title": "Nefertiti", "passage": "Neferneferuaten Nefertiti  (c. 1370 – c. 1330 BC) was an Egyptian queen and the Great Royal Wife of Akhenaten, an Egyptian Pharaoh. Nefertiti and her husband were known for a religious revolution, in which they worshipped one god only, Aten, or the sun disc. With her husband, she reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of Ancient Egyptian history. Some scholars believe that Nefertiti ruled briefly as Neferneferuaten after her husband's death and before the accession of Tutankhamun, although this identification is a matter of ongoing debate. If Nefertiti did rule as Pharaoh, her reign was marked by the fall of Amarna and relocation of the capital back to the traditional city of Thebes. Nefertiti had many titles including Hereditary Princess (iryt-p`t); Great of Praises (wrt-Hzwt); Lady of Grace (nbt-im3t), Sweet of Love (bnrt-mrwt); Lady of The Two Lands (nbt-t3wy); Main King's Wife, his beloved (Hmt-nswt-‘3t mryt.f); Great King's Wife, his beloved (Hmt-nswt-wrt mryt.f), Lady of All Women (Hnwt-Hmwt-nbwt); and Mistress of Upper and Lower Egypt (Hnwt-Shm’w-mhw).

{"title": "Place of birth", "passage": "The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\".

The change in her name reflects the changes in Ancient Egyptian religion during her lifetime after her father's death. Her youth is well documented in the ancient reliefs and paintings of the reign of her parents. Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun shared the same father but Tutankhamun's mother has recently been established by genetic evidence as one of Akhenaten's sisters, a daughter (so far unidentified) of Amenhotep III. Ankhesenamun was definitely married to one king; she was the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Tutankhamun. It is also possible that she was briefly married to Tutankhamun's successor, Ay, believed by some to be her maternal grandfather.

Born in Westminster, Maryland, Shriver pursued a legal career after graduating from Yale Law School. An opponent of U.S. entry into World War II, he helped establish the America First Committee but volunteered for the United States Navy before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

{"title": "Phintys", "passage": "Phintys was a Pythagorean philosopher, probably from the third century BC. She wrote a work on the correct behaviour of women, two extracts of which are preserved by Stobaeus. According to Stobaeus, Phintys was the daughter of Callicrates, who is otherwise unknown. Holger Thesleff suggests that this Callicrates might be identified with Callicratidas, a Spartan general who died at the Battle of Arginusae. If so, this would make Phintys a Spartan, and date her birth to the late fifth century BC, and her floruit to the fourth century. I. M. Plant considers this emendation \"fanciful\". Iamblichus mentions Philtys in his list of female Pythagoreans; he says that she was from Croton and that her father was called Theophrius. I. M. Plant believes that Iamblichus' Philtys, though also a Pythagorean and similarly named, is distinct from Stobaeus' Phintys. Two fragments attributed to Phintys are preserved in Stobaeus. However, not all scholars agree that the fragments are authentic: Lefkowitz and Fant argue that the works attributed to female Pythagoreans, including Phintys, were actually rhetorical exercises written by men. They are written in the Doric dialect, and amount to about 80 lines of prose. The language used dates to around the fourth century BC, although some features of it appear to be deliberate archaisms; it was likely actually composed in the third century BC, though a date as late as the second century AD was suggested by Friedrich Wilhelm in 1915. The fragments discuss the differences between men and women, and argues for chastity as the most important virtue for women. She gives a series of ways that women ought to practice self-control, concluding that the most effective way is to only have sex with her husband in order to produce legitimate children. Along with her defence of women's chastity, Phintys argues that the practice of philosophy is appropriate for women as well as men.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was Phintys?", "answer": "Phintys was a Pythagorean philosopher, probably from the third century BC."}, {"question": "What did Phintys write about?", "answer": "Phintys wrote a work on the correct behaviour of women."}, {"question": "Who preserved two extracts of Phintys' work?", "answer": "Two extracts of Phintys' work were preserved by Stobaeus."}, {"question": "Who was Phintys' father?", "answer": "Phintys' father was Callicrates, who is otherwise unknown."}, {"question": "What is the suggestion made by Holger Thesleff about Callicrates?", "answer": "Holger Thesleff suggests that Callicrates might be identified with Callicratidas, a Spartan general who died at the Battle of Arginusae."}, {"question": "If Callicrates was Callicratidas, what would that make Phintys?", "answer": "If Callicrates was Callicratidas, that would make Phintys a Spartan."}, {"question": "What is the suggested birth date for Phintys if she was a Spartan?", "answer": "If Phintys was a Spartan, her birth would be dated to the late fifth century BC."}, {"question": "What is the suggested floruit of Phintys?", "answer": "The suggested floruit of Phintys is the fourth century BC."}, {"question": "What does I.

A committed Marxist–Leninist , Ramírez Sánchez was one of the most notorious political terrorists of his era. When he joined the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in 1970, recruiting officer Bassam Abu Sharif gave him the code name \"Carlos\" because of his South American roots. After several bungled bombings, Ramírez Sánchez led the 1975 raid on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) headquarters in Vienna, which killed three people. This was followed by a string of attacks against Western targets. For many years he was among the most-wanted international fugitives. Carlos was dubbed \"The Jackal\" by \"The Guardian\" after one of its correspondents reportedly spotted Frederick Forsyth's 1971 novel \"The Day of the Jackal\" near some of the fugitive's belongings. For his part, Ramírez Sánchez denied the 1975 French killings, saying they were orchestrated by Mossad, the Israeli secret service, and condemned Israel as a terrorist state. During his trial in France in 1997, he said, \"When one wages war for 30 years, there is a lot of blood spilled—mine and others. But we never killed anyone for money, but for a cause—the liberation of Palestine. \" In 2017 he claimed responsibility for a total of 80 deaths, and boasted that \"no one in the Palestinian resistance has executed more people than I have.\"", "qa": [{"question": "What is the full name of Carlos the Jackal?", "answer": "The full name of Carlos the Jackal is Ilich Ramírez Sánchez."},

{"title": "Elizabeth of York", "passage": "Elizabeth of York (11 February 1466 – 11 February 1503) was the first queen consort of England of the Tudor dynasty from 18 January 1486 until her death, as the wife of Henry VII. She married Henry in 1485 after his victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field, which marked the end of the Wars of the Roses. Together, Elizabeth and Henry had seven, possibly eight, children. After the death of her father, King Edward IV, Elizabeth's brothers the \"Princes in the Tower\" disappeared, their fate uncertain. Although the 1484 act of Parliament \"Titulus Regius\" declared the marriage of her parents, Edward and Elizabeth Woodville, invalid, she and her sisters were subsequently welcomed back to court by Edward's brother, King Richard III. As a Yorkist princess, the final victory of the Lancastrian faction in the War of the Roses may have seemed a further disaster, but Henry Tudor knew the importance of Yorkist support for his invasion and promised to marry Elizabeth before he arrived in England. This may well have contributed to the hemorrhaging of Yorkist support for Richard. Although Elizabeth seems to have played little part in politics, her marriage appears to have been a successful one. Her eldest son Arthur, Prince of Wales, died at age 15 in 1502, and three other children died young. Her second, and only surviving, son became King Henry VIII of England, while her daughters Mary and Margaret became queen of France and queen of Scotland, respectively; many modern royals, including Elizabeth II, trace their line through Margaret.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was Elizabeth of York?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York was the first queen consort of England of the Tudor dynasty."}, {"question": "When was Elizabeth of York born?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York was born on 11 February 1466."}, {"question": "When did Elizabeth of York die?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York died on 11 February 1503."}, {"question": "Who was Elizabeth of York's husband?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York's husband was Henry VII."}, {"question": "When did Elizabeth of York marry Henry VII?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York married Henry VII on 18 January 1486."}, {"question": "What event marked the end of the Wars of the Roses?", "answer": "The Battle of Bosworth Field marked the end of the Wars of the Roses."}, {"question": "How many children did Elizabeth of York have with Henry VII?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York and Henry VII had seven, possibly eight, children."}, {"question": "What happened to Elizabeth of York's brothers, the Princes in the Tower?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York's brothers, the Princes in the Tower, disappeared, and their fate remains uncertain."}, {"question": "What was the impact of the 1484 act of Parliament 'Titulus Regius' on Elizabeth of York?", "answer": "The 1484 act of Parliament 'Titulus Regius' declared the marriage of Elizabeth of York's parents, Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville, invalid."}, {"question": "How were Elizabeth of York and her sisters treated after the 1484 act of Parliament 'Titulus Regius'?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York and her sisters were welcomed back to court by Edward IV's brother, King Richard III."}, {"question": "Why did Henry Tudor promise to marry Elizabeth of York before arriving in England?", "answer": "Henry Tudor promised to marry Elizabeth of York before arriving in England to gain Yorkist support for his invasion."}, {"question": "What role did Elizabeth of York play in politics?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York seems to have played little part in politics."}, {"question": "Did Elizabeth of York's marriage to Henry VII seem successful?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York's marriage to Henry VII appears to have been a successful one."}, {"question": "How old was Arthur, Prince of Wales when he died?", "answer": "Arthur, Prince of Wales, died at age 15."}, {"question": "When did Arthur, Prince of Wales die?", "answer": "Arthur, Prince of Wales, died in 1502."}, {"question": "Which of Elizabeth of York's children became King of England?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York's second, and only surviving, son became King Henry VIII of England."}, {"question": "Which of Elizabeth of York's daughters became queen of France?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York's daughter, Mary, became queen of France."}, {"question": "Which of Elizabeth of York's daughters became queen of Scotland?", "answer": "Elizabeth of York's daughter, Margaret, became queen of Scotland."}, {"question": "How is Elizabeth II related to Elizabeth of York?", "answer": "Many modern royals, including Elizabeth II, trace their line through Elizabeth of York's daughter, Margaret."}]}

{"title": "Grace Kelly", "passage": "Grace Patricia Kelly (November 12, 1929September 14, 1982) was an American film actress who, after starring in several significant films in the early- to mid-1950s, became Princess of Monaco by marrying Prince Rainier III in April 1956. After embarking on an acting career in 1950 when she was 20, Kelly appeared in New York City theatrical productions and more than 40 episodes of live drama productions broadcast during the early 1950s Golden Age of Television. From 1952 to 1956 she starred in several critically and commercially successful films, usually opposite male romantic leads 25 to 30 years older than her. In October 1953, she gained stardom from her performance in director John Ford's African-filmed adventure-romance \"Mogambo\", starring Clark Gable and Ava Gardner, which won her a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In 1954 she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her deglamorized performance in the drama \"The Country Girl\" with Bing Crosby. Other noteworthy films in which she starred include the western \"High Noon\" (1952), with Gary Cooper; the romance-comedy musical \"High Society\" (1956), with Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra; and three Alfred Hitchcock suspense thrillers in rapid succession: \"Dial M for Murder\" (1954), with Ray Milland; \"Rear Window\" (1954), with James Stewart; and \"To Catch a Thief\" (1955), with Cary Grant. Kelly retired from acting at the age of 26 to marry Rainier, and began her duties as Princess of Monaco. It is well known that Hitchcock was hoping she would appear in more of his films which required an \"icy blonde\" lead actress, but he was unable to coax her out of retirement. Kelly and Rainier had three children: Princess Caroline, Prince Albert, and Princess Stéphanie. Kelly retained her link to America by her dual U.S. and Monégasque citizenship. Princess Grace died at Monaco Hospital on September 14, 1982, succumbing to injuries sustained in a traffic collision the previous day. At the time of her death she was 52 years old.

{"title": "Charles VII of France", "passage": "Charles VII (22 February 1403 – 22 July 1461), called the Victorious  or the Well-Served , was King of France from 1422 to his death in 1461. In the midst of the Hundred Years' War, Charles VII inherited the throne of France under desperate circumstances. Forces of the Kingdom of England and the Duke of Burgundy occupied Guyenne and northern France, including Paris, the most populous city, and Reims, the city in which the French kings were traditionally crowned. In addition, his father Charles VI had disinherited him in 1420 and recognized Henry V of England and his heirs as the legitimate successors to the French crown instead. At the same time, a civil war raged in France between the Armagnacs (supporters of the House of Valois) and the Burgundian party (supporters of the House of Valois-Burgundy allied to the English). With his court removed to Bourges, south of the Loire River, Charles was disparagingly called the “King of Bourges”, because the area around this city was one of the few remaining regions left to him. However, his political and military position improved dramatically with the emergence of Joan of Arc as a spiritual leader in France. Joan of Arc and other charismatic figures led French troops to lift the siege of Orléans, as well as other strategic cities on the Loire river, and to crush the English at the battle of Patay. With the local English troops dispersed, the people of Reims switched allegiance and opened their gates, which enabled the coronation of Charles VII in 1429 at Reims Cathedral. A few years later he ended the English-Burgundian alliance by signing the Treaty of Arras in 1435, followed by the recovery of Paris in 1436 and the steady reconquest of Normandy in the 1440s using a newly organized professional army and advanced siege cannons. Following the battle of Castillon in 1453, the French expelled the English from all their continental possessions except for the Pale of Calais. The last years of Charles VII were marked by conflicts with his turbulent son, the future Louis XI of France.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was Charles VII of France?", "answer": "Charles VII of France, called the Victorious or the Well-Served, was King of France from 1422 to his death in 1461."}, {"question": "When was Charles VII of France born?", "answer": "Charles VII of France was born on 22 February 1403."}, {"question": "When did Charles VII of France die?", "answer": "Charles VII of France died on 22 July 1461."}, {"question": "What was Charles VII of France also known as?", "answer": "Charles VII of France was also known as the Victorious or the Well-Served."}, {"question": "What circumstances surrounded Charles VII's inheritance of the French throne?", "answer": "Charles VII inherited the French throne in the midst of the Hundred Years' War under desperate circumstances, with forces of the Kingdom of England and the Duke of Burgundy occupying parts of France."}, {"question": "Which regions of France were occupied by the Kingdom of England and the Duke of Burgundy when Charles VII inherited the throne?", "answer": "The Kingdom of England and the Duke of Burgundy occupied Guyenne, northern France, including Paris, and Reims when Charles VII inherited the throne."}, {"question": "What was the significance of the city of Reims for French kings?", "answer": "Reims was the city in which French kings were traditionally crowned."}, {"question": "Why was Charles VII called the 'King of Bourges'?", "answer": "Charles VII was disparagingly called the 'King of Bourges' because his court was removed to Bourges, one of the few remaining regions left to him."}, {"question": "What internal conflict was taking place in France during Charles VII's reign?", "answer": "A civil war raged in France between the Armagnacs, supporters of the House of Valois, and the Burgundian party, supporters of the House of Valois-Burgundy allied to the English."}, {"question": "Who was Joan of Arc and how did she influence Charles VII's reign?", "answer": "Joan of Arc was a spiritual leader who emerged in France and led French troops to lift the siege of Orléans, crush the English at the battle of Patay, and enable the coronation of Charles VII in 1429."}, {"question": "What role did Joan of Arc play in Charles VII's coronation?", "answer": "Joan of Arc helped lift the siege of Orléans and other strategic cities, which led to the people of Reims switching allegiance and opening their gates, enabling the coronation of Charles VII in 1429 at Reims Cathedral."}, {"question": "When was Charles VII crowned King of France?", "answer": "Charles VII was crowned King of France in 1429 at Reims Cathedral."}, {"question": "What was the Treaty of Arras and what did it signify for Charles VII?", "answer": "The Treaty of Arras, signed in 1435, ended the English-Burgundian alliance and was a significant diplomatic victory for Charles VII."}, {"question": "When did Charles VII recover Paris?", "answer": "Charles VII recovered Paris in 1436."}, {"question": "What military developments occurred under Charles VII's reign?", "answer": "Under Charles VII's reign, the recovery of Normandy was achieved in the 1440s using a newly organized professional army and advanced siege cannons."}, {"question": "What happened after the battle of Castillon in 1453?", "answer": "After the battle of Castillon in 1453, the French expelled the English from all their continental possessions except for the Pale of Calais."}, {"question": "Who was Charles VII's son and what was the relationship between them?", "answer": "Charles VII's son was Louis XI of France, and their relationship was marked by conflicts, especially in the later years of Charles VII's reign."}]}

{"title": "Selena", "passage": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez (April 16, 1971 – March 31, 1995) was an American singer, songwriter, spokesperson, model, actress, and fashion designer. Called the Queen of Tejano music, her contributions to music and fashion made her one of the most celebrated Mexican-American entertainers of the late 20th century. \"Billboard\" magazine named her the top-selling Latin artist of the 1990s decade, while her posthumous collaboration with MAC cosmetics became the best-selling celebrity collection in cosmetics history. Media outlets called her the \"Tejano Madonna\" for her clothing choices. She also ranks among the most influential Latin artists of all time and is credited for catapulting a music genre into the mainstream market. The youngest child of the Quintanilla family, she debuted on the music scene in 1980 as a member of the band Selena y Los Dinos, which also included her elder siblings A.B. Quintanilla and Suzette Quintanilla. She began recording professionally in 1982. In the 1980s, she was often criticized and was refused bookings at venues across Texas for performing Tejano music—a male-dominated music genre. However, her popularity grew after she won the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year in 1987, which she won nine consecutive times. She signed with EMI Latin in 1989 and released her self-titled debut album the same year, while her brother became her principal music producer and songwriter. Selena released \"Entre a Mi Mundo\" (1992), which peaked at number one on the US \"Billboard\" Regional Mexican Albums chart for eight consecutive months. The album's commercial success led music critics to call it the \"breakthrough\" recording of her musical career. One of its singles, \"Como la Flor\", became one of her most popular signature songs. \"Live!\" (1993) won Best Mexican/American Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards, becoming the first recording by a female Tejano artist to do so. In 1994, she released \"Amor Prohibido\", which became one of the best-selling Latin albums in the United States. It was critically acclaimed as being responsible for Tejano music's first marketable era as it became one of the most popular Latin music subgenres at the time. Selena and her guitarist, Chris Pérez, eloped in April 1992 after her father raised concerns over their relationship. On March 31, 1995, she was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldívar, her friend and former manager of her Selena Etc. boutiques. Saldívar was cornered by police when she attempted to flee, and threatened to kill herself, but was convinced to give herself up and was sentenced to life in prison with possible parole after 30 years. Two weeks later, future US President George W. Bush—governor of Texas at the time—declared Selena's birthday Selena Day in Texas. Her posthumous crossover album, \"Dreaming of You\" (1995), debuted atop the \"Billboard\" 200, making Selena the first Latin artist to do this feat. In 1997, Warner Bros. released \"Selena\", a film about her life and career, which starred Jennifer Lopez as Selena and Lupe Ontiveros as Saldívar. , Selena has sold 60-65 million albums worldwide, making her one of the best-selling female artist in Latin music history.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was Selena Quintanilla-Pérez?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was an American singer, songwriter, spokesperson, model, actress, and fashion designer."}, {"question": "What nickname was Selena Quintanilla-Pérez given?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was called the Queen of Tejano music."}, {"question": "When was Selena Quintanilla-Pérez born?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was born on April 16, 1971."}, {"question": "When did Selena Quintanilla-Pérez die?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez died on March 31, 1995."}, {"question": "What did Billboard magazine name Selena Quintanilla-Pérez in the 1990s?", "answer": "Billboard magazine named Selena Quintanilla-Pérez the top-selling Latin artist of the 1990s decade."}, {"question": "What was Selena Quintanilla-Pérez's collaboration with MAC cosmetics known for?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez's posthumous collaboration with MAC cosmetics became the best-selling celebrity collection in cosmetics history."}, {"question": "What media outlet called Selena Quintanilla-Pérez the 'Tejano Madonna'?", "answer": "Media outlets called Selena Quintanilla-Pérez the 'Tejano Madonna' for her clothing choices."}, {"question": "How is Selena Quintanilla-Pérez regarded in Latin music?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez is regarded as one of the most influential Latin artists of all time."}, {"question": "What genre of music did Selena Quintanilla-Pérez contribute to?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez contributed to Tejano music."}, {"question": "What was Selena Quintanilla-Pérez's role in the popularization of Tejano music?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez is credited with catapulting Tejano music into the mainstream market."}, {"question": "Who were Selena Quintanilla-Pérez's bandmates in Selena y Los Dinos?", "answer": "Selena Quintanilla-Pérez's bandmates in Selena y Los Dinos were her elder siblings A.B.

{"title": "Muhammad Ali Jinnah", "passage": "Muhammad Ali Jinnah (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a lawyer, politician and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until Pakistan's creation on 14 August 1947, and then as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death. He is revered in Pakistan as \"Quaid-i-AzamGreat Leader\") and \"Baba-i-QaumFather of the Nation\"). His birthday is considered a national holiday in Pakistan. Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his return to British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of \"satyagraha\", which he regarded as political anarchy. By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that Muslims of the Indian subcontinent should have their own state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation. During the Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula for the subcontinent to be united as a single state, leading all parties to agree to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan. As the first Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from the new nation of India to Pakistan after independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable streets, roads and localities in the world are named after Jinnah. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name.

{"title": "Francis I Rákóczi", "passage": "Francis I Rákóczi (February 24, 1645, Gyulafehérvár, Transylvania – July 8, 1676, Zboró, Royal Hungary) was a Hungarian aristocrat, elected prince of Transylvania and father of Hungarian national hero Francis Rákóczi II. Francis Rákóczi was the son of George Rákóczi II, prince of Transylvania, and Sophia Báthory. He was elected prince by the Transylvanian Diet in 1652, during his father's life. However, because of the disastrous Polish campaign of 1657 and its consequences, the Ottoman Empire removed his father from the throne in 1660, and prohibited any Rákóczi to ascend the Transylvanian throne. This left Francis unable to come by his father's legacy; he therefore withdrew to his estates in Royal Hungary. Notably, the Rákóczi family was Calvinist, and they were staunch supporters of the Reformed Church in Hungary. However, Francis' mother, Sophia Báthory, had converted to Calvinism merely for the sake of her marriage. After her husband's death, she returned to Catholicism and supported the Counter Reformation. Francis Rákóczi also became a Catholic, thus acquiring favour with the Catholic Habsburg Court. His mother converted him to Catholicism. He was made a count in 1664. In 1666 Francis married Jelena Zrinska (Hungarian: Zrínyi Ilona), a Croatian countess, and joined the Wesselényi conspiracy (\"Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy\" in Croatia), one leader of which was Jelena's father, Petar Zrinski (Hungarian: Zrínyi Péter). Francis soon became the leader of the conspiracy, and, as a culmination of their anti-Habsburg stratagems, started an armed uprising of nobles in Upper Hungary, while the other conspirators were supposed to start the fight in Croatia. Due to poor organization and discord between the conspirators, however, the Austrian authorities were well informed; they quickly suppressed the Croatian branch of the revolt. When Rákóczi learned that Petar Zrinski had been captured by the Austrians, he laid down his arms and applied for mercy. All other leaders of the conspiracy were executed for high treason; Rákóczi, due to his mother's intervention, and for a ransom of 300,000 forints and several castles, was pardoned.", "qa": [{"question": "When was Francis I Rákóczi born?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi was born on February 24, 1645."}, {"question": "Where was Francis I Rákóczi born?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi was born in Gyulafehérvár, Transylvania."}, {"question": "When did Francis I Rákóczi die?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi died on July 8, 1676."}, {"question": "Where did Francis I Rákóczi die?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi died in Zboró, Royal Hungary."}, {"question": "What was Francis I Rákóczi's title?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi was a Hungarian aristocrat and elected prince of Transylvania."}, {"question": "Who was Francis I Rákóczi's father?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi's father was George Rákóczi II, prince of Transylvania."}, {"question": "Who was Francis I Rákóczi's mother?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi's mother was Sophia Báthory."}, {"question": "In what year was Francis I Rákóczi elected prince of Transylvania?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi was elected prince of Transylvania in 1652."}, {"question": "Who removed George Rákóczi II from the throne?", "answer": "The Ottoman Empire removed George Rákóczi II from the throne in 1660."}, {"question": "Why was George Rákóczi II removed from the throne?", "answer": "George Rákóczi II was removed from the throne by the Ottoman Empire due to the disastrous Polish campaign of 1657 and its consequences."}, {"question": "What happened after George Rákóczi II was removed from the throne?", "answer": "After George Rákóczi II was removed from the throne, the Ottoman Empire prohibited any Rákóczi from ascending the Transylvanian throne."}, {"question": "What did Francis I Rákóczi do after he could not ascend the Transylvanian throne?", "answer": "After he could not ascend the Transylvanian throne, Francis I Rákóczi withdrew to his estates in Royal Hungary."}, {"question": "What religion was the Rákóczi family?", "answer": "The Rákóczi family was Calvinist."}, {"question": "What religion did Francis I Rákóczi's mother, Sophia Báthory, practice?", "answer": "Sophia Báthory initially practiced Calvinism but later returned to Catholicism after her husband's death."}, {"question": "Why did Sophia Báthory convert to Calvinism?", "answer": "Sophia Báthory converted to Calvinism for the sake of her marriage to George Rákóczi II."}, {"question": "Why did Francis I Rákóczi become Catholic?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi became Catholic because his mother, Sophia Báthory, converted him to Catholicism."}, {"question": "What title was Francis I Rákóczi given in 1664?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi was made a count in 1664."}, {"question": "Who did Francis I Rákóczi marry in 1666?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi married Jelena Zrinska (Hungarian: Zrínyi Ilona), a Croatian countess, in 1666."}, {"question": "What conspiracy did Francis I Rákóczi join?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi joined the Wesselényi conspiracy (also known as the 'Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy' in Croatia)."}, {"question": "Who was one of the leaders of the Wesselényi conspiracy?", "answer": "One of the leaders of the Wesselényi conspiracy was Jelena Zrinska's father, Petar Zrinski (Hungarian: Zrínyi Péter)."}, {"question": "What role did Francis I Rákóczi take in the Wesselényi conspiracy?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi became the leader of the Wesselényi conspiracy."}, {"question": "What did Francis I Rákóczi start as part of the Wesselényi conspiracy?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi started an armed uprising of nobles in Upper Hungary as part of the Wesselényi conspiracy."}, {"question": "Where were the other conspirators supposed to start the uprising?", "answer": "The other conspirators were supposed to start the uprising in Croatia."}, {"question": "Why did the Wesselényi conspiracy fail?", "answer": "The Wesselényi conspiracy failed due to poor organization and discord between the conspirators."}, {"question": "How did the Austrian authorities respond to the Wesselényi conspiracy?", "answer": "The Austrian authorities were well informed and quickly suppressed the Croatian branch of the revolt."}, {"question": "What did Francis I Rákóczi do when he learned Petar Zrinski was captured?", "answer": "When Francis I Rákóczi learned that Petar Zrinski had been captured, he laid down his arms and applied for mercy."}, {"question": "What happened to the leaders of the Wesselényi conspiracy?", "answer": "All the leaders of the Wesselényi conspiracy were executed for high treason."}, {"question": "Why was Francis I Rákóczi pardoned after the conspiracy?", "answer": "Francis I Rákóczi was pardoned due to his mother's intervention and for a ransom of 300,000 forints and several castles."}]}

He was a son of Emperor Iyasu I and brother to Emperors Tekle Haymanot I and Dawit III. James Bruce describes Bakaffa as faced with the increasing enfeeblement of the Ethiopian Empire as well as growing intrigue and conspiracies. To respond to these challenges, writes Bruce, Bakaffa was \"silent, secret, and unfathomable in his designs, surrounded by soldiers who were his own slaves, and by new men of his own creation. \" In writing his account of this Emperor's reign, Bruce claims that at the time of his writing no \"Royal Chronicle\" of his reign existed, because it \"would have been a very dangerous book to have been kept in Bacuffa's time; and, accordingly, no person chose ever to run that risk; and the king's particular behaviour afterwards had still the further effect, that nobody would supply this deficiency after his death, a general belief prevailing in Abyssinia that he is alive to this day, and will appear again in all his terrors. \" As a result, Bruce's account of Bakaffa's reign consists of a collection of impressionistic vignettes of selected events—his travels through Ethiopia in disguise, his feigned death, his first meetings with people who were to play an important role during his rule—which support this portrait. In contrast, the editor of the 1805 edition of Bruce's work, Alexander Murray, excised all but the first two paragraphs of his chapter on this ruler, replacing Bruce's material with a summary of a chronicle of the reign, stating that \"the annals of this period are very complete, the public transactions of Bacuffa are well known, though his motives seldom escaped from his own impenetrable breast.\"", "qa": [{"question": "What throne name did Bakaffa use?", "answer": "Bakaffa used the throne name Aṣma Giyorgis."}, {"question": "What later name did Bakaffa adopt?", "answer": "Bakaffa later adopted the name Masih Sagad."}, {"question": "What is the meaning of Bakaffa's throne name Aṣma Giyorgis?", "answer": "The meaning of Bakaffa's throne name Aṣma Giyorgis is 'to whom the anointed bows'."}, {"question": "What title did Bakaffa hold in Ethiopia?", "answer": "Bakaffa held the title 'nəgusä nägäst' (King of Kings) of Ethiopia."}, {"question": "When was Bakaffa born?", "answer": "Bakaffa was born on May 18, 1721."}, {"question": "When did Bakaffa die?", "answer": "Bakaffa died on September 19, 1730."}, {"question": "Who were Bakaffa's parents?", "answer": "Bakaffa's father was Emperor Iyasu I."}, {"question": "Who were Bakaffa's brothers?", "answer": "Bakaffa's brothers were Emperors Tekle Haymanot I and Dawit III."}, {"question": "Which dynasty did Bakaffa belong to?", "answer": "Bakaffa was a member of the Solomonic dynasty."}, {"question": "How did James Bruce describe Bakaffa's reign?", "answer": "James Bruce described Bakaffa's reign as being marked by the increasing enfeeblement of the Ethiopian Empire, growing intrigue, and conspiracies."}, {"question": "How did Bakaffa respond to the challenges he faced during his reign?", "answer": "Bakaffa responded to the challenges by being silent, secret, and unfathomable in his designs, surrounded by soldiers who were his own slaves and by new men of his own creation."}, {"question": "What did James Bruce claim about the Royal Chronicle of Bakaffa's reign?", "answer": "James Bruce claimed that at the time of his writing, no 'Royal Chronicle' of Bakaffa's reign existed because it would have been a dangerous book to keep during Bakaffa's time."}, {"question": "What belief prevailed in Abyssinia regarding Bakaffa after his death?", "answer": "A general belief prevailed in Abyssinia that Bakaffa was still alive and would appear again in all his terrors."}, {"question": "What type of account did James Bruce provide of Bakaffa's reign?", "answer": "James Bruce provided a collection of impressionistic vignettes of selected events, such as Bakaffa's travels through Ethiopia in disguise, his feigned death, and his first meetings with important people."}, {"question": "What did Alexander Murray do in the 1805 edition of James Bruce's work?", "answer": "In the 1805 edition of James Bruce's work, Alexander Murray excised all but the first two paragraphs of Bruce's chapter on Bakaffa and replaced the material with a summary of a chronicle of Bakaffa's reign."}, {"question": "What did Alexander Murray claim about the annals of Bakaffa's reign?", "answer": "Alexander Murray claimed that the annals of Bakaffa's reign were very complete, and the public transactions of Bakaffa were well known."}, {"question": "What did Alexander Murray say about Bakaffa's motives?", "answer": "Alexander Murray stated that Bakaffa's motives seldom escaped from his own impenetrable breast."}]}

It was written and produced by Björk, with additional writing by Sjón and production by Mark Bell. The song was written by the singer specially for the 2004 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony, after a request by the International Olympic Committee. \"Oceania\" was released as a promotional single on 13 August 2004, by One Little Indian Records. The song was written at the ocean's point of view, from which the singer believes all life emerged, and details the human's evolution, whilst accompanied by a choir. \" Oceania\" was generally well received by music critics, who believed it was the best track from \"Medúlla\", although some thought it was not the best choice for a promotional release. The accompanying music video for the song, directed by Lynn Fox, features Björk as \"Mother Oceania\", whilst being jewel-encrusted in dark watery depths, with a colourful sunset and swirling floral creatures above her. A remix of the song, featuring additional lyrics and vocals by Kelis on her point of view of the continents, was featured as a B-side to the \"Who Is It\" single. A piano version also appeared on the DVD single, and was assisted in its creation by Nico Muhly.

{"title": "Augustus II the Strong", "passage": "Augustus II the Strong (12 May 16701 February 1733), also known in Saxony as Frederick Augustus I, was Elector of Saxony from 1697, Imperial Vicar and elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in the years 1697–1706 and from 1709 until his death in 1733. He was succeeded by his son, Augustus III of Poland. Augustus' great physical strength earned him the nicknames \"the Strongthe Saxon Hercules\" and \"Iron-Hand\". He liked to show that he lived up to his name by breaking horseshoes with his bare hands and engaging in fox tossing by holding the end of his sling with just one finger while two of the strongest men in his court held the other end. He is also notable for fathering a very large number of children. In order to be elected King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Augustus converted to Roman Catholicism. As a Catholic, he received the Order of the Golden Fleece from the Holy Roman Emperor. As Elector of Saxony, he is perhaps best remembered as a patron of the arts and architecture. He established the Saxon capital of Dresden as a major cultural centre, attracting artists from across Europe to his court. Augustus also amassed an impressive art collection and built lavish baroque palaces in Dresden and Warsaw. His reigns brought Poland some troubled times. He led the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the Great Northern War, which allowed the Russian Empire to strengthen its influence in Europe, especially within Poland. His main pursuit was bolstering royal power in the Commonwealth, characterized by broad decentralization in comparison with other European monarchies.

{"title": "Marcus Garvey", "passage": "Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr. ONH (17 August 188710 June 1940) was a Jamaican political activist, publisher, journalist, entrepreneur, and orator. He was the founder and first President-General of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL, commonly known as UNIA), through which he declared himself Provisional President of Africa. Ideologically a black nationalist and Pan-Africanist, his ideas came to be known as Garveyism. Garvey was born to a moderately prosperous Afro-Jamaican family in Saint Ann's Bay, Colony of Jamaica and apprenticed into the print trade as a teenager. Working in Kingston, he became involved in trade unionism before living briefly in Costa Rica, Panama, and England. Returning to Jamaica, he founded UNIA in 1914. In 1916, he moved to the United States and established a UNIA branch in New York City's Harlem district. Emphasising unity between Africans and the African diaspora, he campaigned for an end to European colonial rule across Africa and the political unification of the continent. He envisioned a unified Africa as a one-party state, governed by himself, that would enact laws to ensure black racial purity. Although he never visited the continent, he was committed to the Back-to-Africa movement, arguing that many African-Americans should migrate there. Garveyist ideas became increasingly popular and UNIA grew in membership. However, his black separatist views—and his collaboration with white racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) to advance their shared interest in racial separatism—divided Garvey from other prominent African-American civil rights activists such as W. E. B. Du Bois who promoted racial integration. Committed to the belief that African-Americans needed to secure financial independence from white-dominant society, Garvey launched various businesses in the U.S., including the Negro Factories Corporation and \"Negro World\" newspaper. In 1919, he became President of the Black Star Line shipping and passenger company, designed to forge a link between North America and Africa and facilitate African-American migration to Liberia. In 1923 Garvey was convicted of mail fraud for selling the company's stock and imprisoned in the Atlanta State Penitentiary for nearly two years. Many commentators have argued that the trial was politically motivated; Garvey blamed Jewish people, claiming that they were prejudiced against him because of his links to the KKK. Deported to Jamaica in 1927, where he settled in Kingston with his wife Amy Jacques, Garvey continued his activism and established the People's Political Party in 1929, briefly serving as a city councillor. With UNIA in increasing financial difficulty, in 1935 he relocated to London, where his anti-socialist stance distanced him from many of the city's black activists. He died there in 1940, although in 1964 his body was returned to Jamaica for reburial in Kingston's National Heroes Park. Garvey was a controversial figure. Many in the African diasporic community regarded him as a pretentious demagogue and were highly critical of his collaboration with white supremacists, his violent rhetoric, and his prejudice against mixed-race people and Jews. He nevertheless received praise for encouraging a sense of pride and self-worth among Africans and the African diaspora amid widespread poverty, discrimination, and colonialism. He is seen as a national hero in Jamaica, and his ideas exerted a considerable influence on movements like Rastafari, the Nation of Islam, and the Black Power Movement.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was Marcus Garvey?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey was a Jamaican political activist, publisher, journalist, entrepreneur, and orator."}, {"question": "What was Marcus Garvey's full name?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey's full name was Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr."}, {"question": "When was Marcus Garvey born?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey was born on 17 August 1887."}, {"question": "When did Marcus Garvey die?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey died on 10 June 1940."}, {"question": "What organization did Marcus Garvey found?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL), commonly known as UNIA."}, {"question": "What title did Marcus Garvey give himself within the UNIA?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey declared himself Provisional President of Africa."}, {"question": "What ideological movements was Marcus Garvey associated with?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey was associated with black nationalism and Pan-Africanism."}, {"question": "What is Garveyism?", "answer": "Garveyism is the set of ideas associated with Marcus Garvey's ideology, focusing on black nationalism and Pan-Africanism."}, {"question": "Where was Marcus Garvey born?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey was born in Saint Ann's Bay, Colony of Jamaica."}, {"question": "What trade did Marcus Garvey apprentice in as a teenager?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey apprenticed in the print trade as a teenager."}, {"question": "Where did Marcus Garvey live before returning to Jamaica?", "answer": "Before returning to Jamaica, Marcus Garvey lived briefly in Costa Rica, Panama, and England."}, {"question": "When did Marcus Garvey found the UNIA?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey founded the UNIA in 1914."}, {"question": "Where did Marcus Garvey establish a UNIA branch in 1916?", "answer": "In 1916, Marcus Garvey established a UNIA branch in New York City's Harlem district."}, {"question": "What was Marcus Garvey's vision for Africa?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey envisioned a unified Africa as a one-party state, governed by himself, that would enact laws to ensure black racial purity."}, {"question": "What movement did Marcus Garvey promote regarding African-Americans?", "answer": "Marcus Garvey promoted the Back-to-Africa movement, advocating for African-Americans to migrate to Africa."}, {"question": "Which prominent African-American civil rights activist disagreed with Marcus Garvey's views?", "answer": "W.

King was also a singer who often incorporated music into her civil rights work. King met her husband while attending graduate school in Boston. They both became increasingly active in the American Civil Rights Movement. King played a prominent role in the years after her husband's assassination in 1968 when she took on the leadership of the struggle for racial equality herself and became active in the Women's Movement. King founded the King Center and sought to make his birthday a national holiday. She finally succeeded when Ronald Reagan signed legislation which established Martin Luther King Jr. Day on November 2, 1983. She later broadened her scope to include both advocacy for LGBT rights and opposition to apartheid. King became friends with many politicians before and after Martin Luther King's death, including John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Robert F. Kennedy. Her telephone conversation with John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election has been credited by historians for mobilizing African-American voters. In August 2005, King suffered a stroke which paralyzed her right side and left her unable to speak; five months later she died of respiratory failure due to complications from ovarian cancer. Her funeral was attended by some 10,000 people, including four of five living US presidents. She was temporarily buried on the grounds of the King Center until being interred next to her husband.

{"title": "Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham", "passage": "Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, 6th Earl of Stafford, (December 1402 – 10 July 1460) was an English nobleman and a military commander in the Hundred Years' War and the Wars of the Roses. Through his mother he had royal descent from King Edward III, his great-grandfather, and from his father, he inherited, at an early age, the earldom of Stafford. By his marriage to a daughter of Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, Humphrey was related to the powerful Neville family and to many of the leading aristocratic houses of the time. He joined the English campaign in France with King Henry V in 1420 and following Henry V's death two years later he became a councillor for the new King, the nine-month-old Henry VI. Stafford acted as a peacemaker during the partisan, factional politics of the 1430s, when Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, vied with Cardinal Beaufort for political supremacy. Stafford also took part in the eventual arrest of Gloucester in 1447. Stafford returned to the French campaign during the 1430s and for his loyalty and years of service, he was elevated from Earl of Stafford to Duke of Buckingham. Around the same time, his mother died. As much of his estate—as her dower—had previously been in her hands, Humphrey went from having a reduced income in his early years to being one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners in England. His lands stretched across much of the country, ranging from East Anglia to the Welsh border. Being such an important figure in the localities was not without its dangers and for some time he feuded violently with Sir Thomas Malory in the Midlands. After returning from France, Stafford remained in England for the rest of his life, serving King Henry. He acted as the King's bodyguard and chief negotiator during Jack Cade's rebellion of 1450, helping to suppress it. When the King's cousin, Richard, Duke of York, rebelled two years later, Stafford investigated York's followers. In 1453, the King became ill and sank into a catatonic state; law and order broke down further and when civil war began in 1455, Stafford fought for the King in the First Battle of St Albans which began the Wars of the Roses. Both were captured by the Yorkists and Stafford spent most of his final years attempting to mediate between the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions, the latter by now headed by Henry's wife, Margaret of Anjou. Partly due to a feud with a leading Yorkist—Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick—Stafford eventually declared for King Henry and the Duke of York was defeated in 1459, driving York into exile. When the rebels returned the following year they attacked the royal army at Northampton. Acting as the King's personal guard in the ensuing struggle, Stafford was killed and the King was again taken prisoner. Stafford's eldest son had died of plague two years earlier and the Buckingham dukedom descended to Stafford's five-year-old grandson, Henry, a ward of the King until he came of age in 1473.", "qa":

{"title": "Ali ibn Abu Bakr al-Haythami", "passage": "Nur al- Din` Ali ibn Abi Bakr ibn Sulayman, Abu al- Hasan al- Haythami( 735 AH 1335 CE – 807AH 1404 CE) was a Sunni Shafi`i Islamic scholar from Cairo, whose father had a shop on a desert road. He was born in the month of Rajab in 735 H. corresponding to 1335 CE. He learned the Qur'an and memorized it, and when he was a teenager, he became a disciple of a highly renowned scholar of Hadith, Abd Al- Raheem ibn Al- Hussain ibn Abd Al- Rahman, who was better known as Zain Al- Deen Al- Iraqi. Al- Haythami became a committed associate of Al- Iraqi, staying with him all the time, traveling with him when he traveled, and offering the pilgrimage in his company. He attended with him every circle he attended in Cairo, other cities in Egypt, Makkah, Madinah, Jerusalem, Damascus, Baalbak, Aleppo and other places. The only teacher under whom Al- Haythami read, without being attended by Al- Iraqi, was Ibn Abd Al- Hadi, from whom he heard the Sahih collection of Imam Muslim. On the other hand, Al- Iraqi heard from only four teachers without Al- Haythami taking part. Al- Iraqi, who was only ten years older than Al- Haythami, was a highly distinguished scholar of Hadith. Al- Haythami was also to distinguish himself as a scholar of Hadith, but despite his broad scholarly achievement, he preferred to remain in the shadow of his teacher and friend, Al- Iraqi. Indeed, Al- Iraqi relied on Al- Haythami in conducting much of his affairs, and gave him his daughter in marriage. He trained him in a particular area of Hadith scholarship and Al- Haythami was to achieve distinction in this field and to produce highly valuable works in it. This is the area of Zawa’id which we will presently discuss. Al- Haythami was exemplary in his religious devotion, and his serious approach to Hadith scholarship. He cared little for worldly matters, which are the main preoccupation of many people, dedicating himself to the study of Hadith, and associating only with Hadith scholars. While Al- Iraqi was alive, he taught Hadith in his presence. Similarly, Al- Iraqi rarely taught without Al- Haythami being present. But after Al- Iraqi's death, he was sought by many students who wished to read under him. He taught unhesitatingly, but without assuming any personal distinction. He is praised by many scholars for his humility, kindly manner, and dedication to learning. Ibn Hajar, a Hadith scholar of the highest caliber who studied much under Al- Haythami, describes him as very kind, highly critical of anyone indulging in a practice that is unacceptable to Islam, yet he was extremely tolerant when it came to personal grievances. When other students of Al- Iraqi repeatedly tried to irritate him, he simply tolerated them without much complaint. While many scholars mention his commitment to his teacher, showing him great respect in all situations, all are agreed that his own knowledge was broad, and that he distinguished himself by his great achievement in Hadith scholarship. They are also agreed that he was highly devoted in his worship, very pious and very kind in his dealing with other people. As we have already said, Al- Haythami distinguished himself in a particular area of Hadith scholarship, namely Zawa’id, which linguistically means ‘ addition or increase ’. This is a comparative study seeking to identify all the Hadiths that are listed in a collection by a distinguished Hadith scholar but are not listed in any of the six main Hadith collections. This is highly useful for students of Hadith, because it identifies for them which Hadiths they need to learn from any particular collection, if they have already learned the six main ones. Moreover, many of these collections, from which Al- Haythami extracted the Zawa’id, are not arranged according to topics of Fiqh, while Al- Haythami arranged them on this basis, which makes for easier reference. Hence, his work is highly valuable. In all, Al- Haythami extracted the Zawa’id from Al- Musnad by Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and also from Al- Bazzar's collection, Ibn Hibban's Sahih, Al- Musnad by Abu Ya’la, as well as the three collections named Al- Mu’jam by Al- Tabarani, and then collected all these and listed them all in one voluminous work which he called Majma ’ Al- Zawa’id wa Manba ’ Al- Fawa’id. He dropped all chains of transmission and arranged his book according to the topics of Fiqh, which is the pattern used in the six main collections of Hadith. He graded each Hadith, pointing out which were authentic and which lacked in authenticity. Alternatively, he would mention names of narrators who were questioned or regarded as unreliable. It should be pointed out that not all Al- Haythami's gradings were acceptable to later Hadith scholars. The book was published in 10 volumes by Qudsi in Cairo about 70 years ago, but more recently, a new annotated edition was published by Dar Al- Fikr in Beirut, Lebanon. The omission of chains of transmission, justified on grounds of brevity, has been felt as a defect in this work, but it remains a great encyclopedia of Hadith. Al- Haythami was praised for it by his contemporaries and by later scholars. Al- Haythami died on 19 Ramadan 807 H, corresponding to 1405 CE.

Petko was born in the Bulgarian village of Dogan Hisar, today Aisymi( Evros regional unit, Greece). He married a Greek lady from Maronia in 1860. When a group of Turkish brigands attacked his wife, he fought and killed them all, including the leader of the bashibuzuks, Mehmed Kesedji Bey. Beginning in 1861 Petko began fighting against the Ottomans in the surrounding areas of Maroneia, Aisymi, Enos etc. He visited Italy in 1866, where he met Giuseppe Garibaldi, who became a close friend. Petko lived in Garibaldi's home for a few months. Garibaldi helped Petko organize the well- known\" Garibaldi Battalion\" in the Cretan Revolution of 1866 – 1869, consisting of 220 Italians and 67 Bulgarians, who fought the Ottomans on Crete under Petko's command. For his service, Petko was assigned the military title of\" Kapetan\"( Captain). Petko Voyvoda's detachment, established in 1869, took part in the Russo- Turkish War of 1877- 78. His unit liberated Maroneia from the Turkish rule in December 1877, establishing a Christian government there. He fought against the Turks for three months and saved the local population from Turkish oppression. After that, he took part in the liberation of the Rhodopes together with Kraycho Voyvoda. As part of this effort, he led the defeat of the 1878 Muslim insurgence in the Rhodopes organized by the British agent Saint Clair. With his son and new wife Rada Kravkova from Kazanlak Petko lived in Varna after 1880 and died in that city in 1900. He founded the revolutionary committee called\" Strandzha\" there in 1896.

He has also provided English language football commentary for Eurosport and ESPN. He is currently a commentator for BT Sport on their coverage of the Bundesliga, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. He first worked for Ladbrokes, providing racing commentary into their betting shops, but rose to fame as\" Statto\", the resident statistician on the BBC Two television show\" Fantasy Football League\".

The boy in question was the young Angus Loughran, or Fantasy Football's Statto as he would later become known. The interruption entertained the agitated fans, and even amused officials so much that Loughran was offered life membership to the Oval. And he also made a profit during his one- man protest. His friends, thinking reasonably that he would n't be able to pull off such a stunt, invested in Loughran's bet, meaning that there was £ 300 riding on the wager. \" I figured I'd probably be arrested but the fine would only be £ 100, so I'd still be £ 200 up,\" Loughran later revealed, showing a nose for a money- making scheme even from an early age.\" He was declared bankrupt at a hearing at Manchester County Court on 4 February 2008 due to large debts owed to Sporting Index.

The situation plunges into chaos when multiple genetically engineered sharks go on a rampage and flood the facility. \" Deep Blue Sea\" had a budget of$ 82 million and represented a test for Harlin, who had not made a commercially successful film since\" Cliffhanger\" in 1993. The film was primarily shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron's 1997 film\" Titanic\". Although\" Deep Blue Sea\" features some shots of real sharks, most of the sharks used in the film were either animatronic or computer generated. Trevor Rabin composed the film score; LL Cool J contributed two songs to the film:\" Deepest Bluest( Shark's Fin)\" and\" Say What\". Released in theaters during the film industry's summer season,\" Deep Blue Sea\" was a moderate commercial success, grossing more than$ 73 million in the United States and Canada, and$ 164 million worldwide. The film received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised its suspense, pacing, and action sequences. Criticism was targeted at its unoriginality and B movie conventions.

{"title": "Maria of Jülich-Berg", "passage": "Maria of Jülich-Berg (3 August 1491 – 29 August 1543) was born in Jülich, the daughter of Wilhelm IV, Duke of Jülich-Berg and Sibylle of Brandenburg. Maria came from the line of German princesses that stretched back to Sybille of Brandenberg, Sophia of Saxony, and Adelaide of Teck. Maria became heiress to her father's estates of Jülich, Berg and Ravensberg after his death in 1511. In her marriage to John III, Duke of Cleves in 1509, Maria's estates and titles were eventually merged with the Duchy of Cleves. John, who inherited the Duchy of Cleves-Mark in 1521, then became the first ruler of the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, which would exist until 1666. She married John III, Duke of Cleves in 1509, by whom she had three daughters and a son.

Maria was a strict, traditional Catholic and not a proponent of educating princesses and noble women, which by this point was the norm for the English nobility and gentry. In \"The Wives of Henry VIII\", Antonia Fraser suggests that, following their marriage, one reason Henry VIII disliked her daughter Anne so much was that, unlike his first two wives and many of the court ladies around him, Anne did not possess educational and musical accomplishments and was ill-equipped to function in the contentious English court.

All too soon he learned that the French did not lift a finger to help him, and he was overwhelmed and had to surrender. In accordance with the Treaty of Venlo( 1543) that was the result of this war, Guelders and the County of Zutphen were transferred to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, combining them with the Habsburg Netherlands. William then tried to strengthen his inherited territories and launched an impressive development project for the most important cities. The three duchies all got new main fortresses as major strongpoints, for the older medieval fortifications had proved to be no match against the Imperial artillery. The cities of Jülich, Düsseldorf and Orsoy became fortresses for the duchies of Jülich, Berg and Cleves respectively, and Jülich and Düsseldorf were turned into impressive residences. For this task, the renowned Italian architect Alessandro Pasqualini from Bologna was hired, who had already made some impressive display of his craft in the Netherlands. He made the plans for the fortifications and palaces, of which some traces still remain, especially at Jülich where the citadel( built 1548- 1580) is a major landmark, with parts of the Renaissance palace still standing. William's sister Anne of Cleves was, for six months, the fourth wife of King Henry VIII of England. Through his daughter Marie Eleonore, he is ancestor of Marie Louise of Hesse- Kassel, wife of John William Friso, Prince of Orange therefore ancestor of all the current European monarchs.", "qa":

{"title": "Magdalene of Jülich-Cleves-Berg", "passage": "Duchess Magdalene of Jülich-Cleves-Berg (2 November 1553 – 30 August 1633) was the fifth child of Duke William \"the rich\" of Jülich-Cleves-Berg and Maria of Austria, a daughter of Emperor Ferdinand I. She married in 1579 with Count Palatine John I \"the lame\" of Zweibrücken. Emperor Charles V had in 1546 granted the Duchy of Jülich-Cleves-Berg the right of female succession. So, when her brother, Duke John William, died in 1609 without a male heir of his own, both she and William's daughters could play a vital role in the question of who would inherit the important northwest German territory. Magdalene's husband John claimed the inheritance for Palatinate-Zweibrücken, as did the Elector of Brandenburg, John Sigismund, who was married to Anna, a daughter of Magdalena's sister Marie Eleonore (John Sigismund claimed his marriage contract from 1573 gave him the best claim). The third claimant was Count Palatine Philip Louis of Neuburg, the husband of Magdalen's other sister Anna. Finally, the Duchy of Saxony claimed Jülich-Cleves-Berg, based on an agreement to that effect with the Emperor. Since all claimants were members of comprehensive European coalitions and so the Habsburgs and France were indirectly involved, an international conflict threatened: the War of the Jülich succession. However, after King Henry IV of France died, the conflict could be settled provisionally by the Treaty of Xanten. The duchy was divided between Brandenburg and Palatinate-Neuburg. In the meantime, Magdalena's husband had died in 1604 and his claim had been inherited by her eldest son John II (1584–1635), who did not receive a share under the Treaty of Xanten. Magdalene's daughter Elisabeth (1581–1637) married Georg Gustav, Count Palatine of Pfalz-Veldenz. She also had two younger sons: Frederick Casimir (1585–1645) and John Casimir (1589–1652).

He was subject to mental illness, for which he was treated by the physician Francesco Maria Guazzo. Upon Duke Johann William's death in 1609, his inheritance was claimed by the heirs of his two eldest sisters: the heir of Maria Eleonora of Cleves( 1550 – 1608), the eldest sister and married to Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia, was Anna of Prussia, the Electress of Brandenburg, a Protestant. The second sister was Anna of Cleves( 1552 – 1632), married with Philipp Ludwig, Count Palatine of Neuburg, and her son and heir was the then Count Palatine of Neuburg, a Catholic. The disputes of the epoch between Protestants and Catholics escalated, leading to the Thirty Years' War in 1618; the succession dispute became part of the war.

{"title": "Fleetwood Sheppard", "passage": "Fleetwood Sheppard (sometimes spelled as \"Shepphard,Sheppheard,\" and \"Sheppeard\") (1 January 1634 – 25 August 1698) was a British courtier and literary wit who was instrumental in the courts of Charles II of England and William of Orange. He was an educated man known for his lively wit and honesty, and he was an important figure in the poetry of the 1680s and 1690s. He was born in Oxfordshire, attended Magdalen Hall and Christ Church, Oxford, gaining the Bachelor of Arts in 1654 and Master of Arts in 1657. When all persons attaining an M.A. were required to join the Church of England, King Charles intervened and said that Sheppard had a background in civil law (having studied at Gray's Inn) and was \"not prepared to take orders, he being a person of much ability\" (Ellis 255). Instead, Sheppard became a courtier. He was introduced to Nell Gwynn and became one of her favourite companions, along with Charles Sackville, Lord Buckhurst (later Earl of Dorset). He would remain one of Dorset's closest friends throughout his life. While satirists and gossips (such as Anthony á Wood) said that Sheppard spent his time as \"a debauchee and atheist, a grand companion,\" others suggested that he was a fundamentally honest man who was always interested in a good joke. He became one of Charles II's dining companions, and when Nell Gwynn gave birth to a male child, he was made the steward of Gwynn's household. This prompted a satirist to accuse him of being the best paid pimp in the land. There is little truth to this charge, however, as Sheppard was not paid by the crown for his services, except for two grants of £200. Dorset and Sheppard went to Paris together. Additionally, Dorset would travel out to meet Sheppard when the latter went out to the country. Whether he and Dorset got in trouble in Paris for some scandalous behaviour, as Wood suggests, or not, it is true that Sheppard lived a very active life. He was stabbed beneath the eye while separating Henry Bulkeley and George Etheridge in a quarrel in a tavern. Sheppard was not liked by James II, and Sheppard did not like James, either. When Charles II died, Sheppard went into retirement. However, when William came to the throne, Sheppard was back at court and back in favour. Dorset was made the chamberlain of the royal household, and that gave him a great many places to dispense in patronage. For this, he employed Sheppard. Sheppard received the proceeds from those wishing to purchase places, and he received the favours of those wishing a good word to be placed on their behalf. At the same time, Sheppard was a favourite of the new Queen's, and John Oldmixon said that he made the Queen \"very merry.\" In \"A New Way of Selling Places at Court\" in 1712, Jonathan Swift would say that Fleetwood Sheppard sold places that did not exist and named successors for posts that were not vacant, that he enriched himself greatly. In 1690 he was made a gentleman usher to the king. In 1694 he was knighted, became a gentleman usher to the black rod in the House of Lords, and was inducted as a knight of the garter. Sheppard was a patron of many poets and one of those who discovered others. He was one of the ones, for example, who \"discoveredParadise Lost\" when Buckhurst bought it from a small stall at a fair. He was also present when Matthew Prior was discovered reading Horace as a tap puller in a bar and sent to school to cultivate his talents. He was also one of the main supports of Robert Gould, as well as John Oldmixon. He may have embraced the Puritan cause around 1695, and some of his old friends were disaffected by this change. Charles Gildon, Thomas Rymer, and John Dennis dedicated volumes of literary criticism to Sheppard, and John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester regarded Sheppard as the only critic he needed for his verses. In his last years, Sheppard was reported dead several times before he died. In 1694, Lord Godolphin heard a report that Sheppard had died, but Sheppard himself responded, saying that he was alive, but that he had suffered from \"the stone\" for twelve to fourteen years. In December 1697, he was again reported as dead. In July 1698, he was \"again\" reported as dead. He did die shortly afterward, but in 1768 a joking \"Annual Register\" announced that Sheppard was still alive, in good health, and 120 years old.", "qa": [{"question": "What were the variant

{"title": "Matilda of Hainaut", "passage": "Matilda of Hainaut( 29 November 1293 – 1331) was the Princess of Achaea from 1313 to 1318. She was the daughter of Isabella of Villehardouin and her husband Florent of Hainaut. In 1299, while still a child, she had been married to Guy II de la Roche, Duke of Athens. Widowed in 1308, she was engaged to Charles of Taranto until 1313, when she remarried to Louis of Burgundy, who held the titular dignity of the long- extinct Kingdom of Thessalonica. The marriage was intended to unite the Angevin and Burgundian houses. So was the betrothal of the Empress Catherine II to Hugh V of Burgundy, Louis's elder brother. However, Charles of Valois, Catherine's father, nixed the marriage and instead married her to Philip of Taranto. It was in an effort to compensate the Burgundians that Philip renounced his claim to Achaea in favour of Matilda and gave her hand to Louis. From 1307, when Philip of Savoy relinquished his claim, to 1312, when Isabella of Villehardouin died, Achaea was disputed between two claimants: Isabella and Philip I of Taranto. In 1313, Philip granted it to Matilda, daughter of Isabella and her first husband Florent of Hainaut. On Isabella's death, however, Ferdinand of Majorca laid claim to the principality in right of his wife, Isabella of Sabran, the daughter of Isabella's younger sister Margaret of Villehardouin. The new couple quickly left for Greece to take possession of their fief, which was then occupied by their rival Ferdinand. At the Battle of Manolada on 5 July 1316, Ferdinand was vanquished and killed and Louis took control of the Elis. However, he was poisoned soon after, leaving a twice- widowed 23- year- old in charge of the Morea. It was soon disputed by the varying claimants and Matilda was solidly dispossessed of her fief by 1318, in which year John, Duke of Durazzo, an Angevin, abducted the princess and forced her to marry him. She did not give him children, however, and he repudiated her in 1321.

{"title": "Guru Arjan", "passage": "Guru Arjan  15 April 1563 – 30 May 1606) was the first of the two Gurus martyred in the Sikh faith and the fifth of the ten total Sikh Gurus. He compiled the first official edition of the Sikh scripture called the Adi Granth, which later expanded into the Guru Granth Sahib. He was born in Goindval, in the Punjab, the youngest son of Bhai Jetha, who later became Guru Ram Das, and Mata Bhani, the daughter of Guru Amar Das. He was the first Guru in Sikhism to be born into a Sikh family. Guru Arjan led Sikhism for a quarter of a century. He completed the construction of Darbar Sahib at Amritsar, after the fourth Sikh Guru founded the town and built a pool. Guru Arjan compiled the hymns of previous Gurus and of other saints into Adi Granth, the first edition of the Sikh scripture, and installed it in the Harimandir Sahib. Guru Arjan reorganized the Masands system initiated by Guru Ram Das, by suggesting that the Sikhs donate, if possible, one-tenth of their income, goods or service to the Sikh organization (\"dasvand\"). The \"Masand\" not only collected these funds but also taught tenets of Sikhism and settled civil disputes in their region. The \"dasvand\" financed the building of gurdwaras and langars (shared communal kitchens). Guru Arjan was arrested under the orders of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir and asked to convert to Islam. He refused, was tortured and executed in 1606 CE. Historical records and the Sikh tradition are unclear whether Guru Arjan was executed by drowning or died during torture.

{"title": "Tlacaelel", "passage": "Tlacaelel I (1397 – 1487) was the principal architect of the Aztec Triple Alliance and hence the Mexica (Aztec) empire. He was the son of Emperor Huitzilihuitl and Queen Cacamacihuatl, nephew of Emperor Itzcoatl, father of poet Macuilxochitzin, and brother of Emperors Chimalpopoca and Moctezuma I. During the reign of his uncle Itzcoatl, Tlacaelel was given the office of Tlacochcalcatl, but during the war against the Tepanecs in the late 1420s, he was promoted to first adviser to the ruler, a position called \"Cihuacoatl\" in Nahuatl, an office that Tlacaelel held during the reigns of four consecutive \"Tlatoque\", until his death in 1487. Tlacaelel recast or strengthened the concept of the Aztecs as a chosen people, elevated the tribal god/hero Huitzilopochtli to top of the pantheon of gods, and increased militarism. In tandem with this, Tlacaelel is said to have increased the level and prevalence of human sacrifice, particularly during a period of natural disasters that started in 1446 (according to Diego Durán). Durán also states that it was during the reign of Moctezuma I, as an invention of Tlacaelel that the flower wars, in which the Aztecs fought Tlaxcala and other Nahuan city-states, were instigated. To strengthen the Aztec nobility, he helped create and enforce sumptuary laws, prohibiting commoners from wearing certain adornments such as lip plugs, gold armbands, and cotton cloaks. He also instigated a policy of burning the books of conquered peoples with the aim of erasing all memories of a pre-Aztec past. When he dedicated the seventh reconstruction of the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan, Tlacaelel had brought his nation to the height of its power. The dedication took place in 1484 and was celebrated with the sacrifice of many war captives. After Tlacaelel's death in 1487, the Mexica Empire continued to expand north into the Gran Chichimeca and south toward the Maya lands.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was Tlacaelel I?", "answer": "Tlacaelel I was the principal architect of the Aztec Triple Alliance and the Mexica (Aztec) empire."}, {"question": "When did Tlacaelel I live?", "answer": "Tlacaelel I lived from 1397 to 1487."}, {"question": "Who were the parents of Tlacaelel I?", "answer": "Tlacaelel I was the son of Emperor Huitzilihuitl and Queen Cacamacihuatl."}, {"question": "Who were the uncles and siblings of Tlacaelel I?", "answer": "Tlacaelel I was the nephew of Emperor Itzcoatl, the brother of Emperors Chimalpopoca and Moctezuma I, and the father of poet Macuilxochitzin."}, {"question": "What office did Tlacaelel I hold during the reign of his uncle Itzcoatl?", "answer": "During the reign of his uncle Itzcoatl, Tlacaelel I held the office of Tlacochcalcatl."}, {"question": "What position did Tlacaelel I hold after being promoted in the 1420s?", "answer": "After being promoted in the 1420s, Tlacaelel I became the first adviser to the ruler, a position called 'Cihuacoatl' in Nahuatl."}, {"question": "How long did Tlacaelel I hold the office of Cihuacoatl?", "answer": "Tlacaelel I held the office of Cihuacoatl during the reigns of four consecutive 'Tlatoque' until his death in 1487."}, {"question": "What concept did Tlacaelel I recast or strengthen?", "answer": "Tlacaelel I recast or strengthened the concept of the Aztecs as a chosen people."}, {"question": "What god did Tlacaelel I elevate to the top of the Aztec pantheon?", "answer": "Tlacaelel I elevated the tribal god/hero Huitzilopochtli to the top of the Aztec pantheon of gods."}, {"question": "What did Tlacaelel I increase in Aztec society?", "answer": "Tlacaelel I increased militarism and the level and prevalence of human sacrifice in Aztec society."}, {"question": "Why did Tlacaelel I increase human sacrifice?", "answer": "Tlacaelel I increased human sacrifice during a period of natural disasters that started in 1446."}, {"question": "What were the flower wars, and who instigated them?", "answer": "The flower wars were conflicts in which the Aztecs fought Tlaxcala and other Nahuan city-states, and they were instigated by Tlacaelel I during the reign of Moctezuma I."}, {"question": "What did Tlacaelel I do to strengthen the Aztec nobility?", "answer": "To strengthen the Aztec nobility, Tlacaelel I helped create and enforce sumptuary laws, prohibiting commoners from wearing certain adornments."}, {"question": "What sumptuary laws did Tlacaelel I help create?", "answer": "Tlacaelel I helped create sumptuary laws that prohibited commoners from wearing adornments such as lip plugs, gold armbands, and cotton cloaks."}, {"question": "What policy did Tlacaelel I instigate regarding books?", "answer": "Tlacaelel I instigated a policy of burning the books of conquered peoples with the aim of erasing all memories of a pre-Aztec past."}, {"question": "When did Tlacaelel I dedicate the seventh reconstruction of the Templo Mayor?", "answer": "Tlacaelel I dedicated the seventh reconstruction of the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan in 1484."}, {"question": "What event occurred during the dedication of the seventh reconstruction of the Templo Mayor?", "answer": "During the dedication of the seventh reconstruction of the Templo Mayor, many war captives were sacrificed."}, {"question": "What happened to the Mexica Empire after Tlacaelel I's death?", "answer": "After Tlacaelel I's death in 1487, the Mexica Empire continued to expand north into the Gran Chichimeca and south toward the Maya lands."}]}

Beresford was the second son of John Beresford, 4th Marquess of Waterford, thus despite his courtesy title as the younger son of a Marquess, he was still eligible to enter the House of Commons. He combined the two careers of the navy and a member of parliament, making a reputation as a hero in battle and champion of the navy in the House of Commons. He was a well- known and popular figure who courted publicity, widely known to the British public as\" Charlie B\". He was considered by many to be a personification of John Bull, indeed was normally accompanied by his trademark, a bulldog.

{"title": "Claudius", "passage": "Claudius (1 August 10 BC – 13 October AD 54) was a Roman emperor from AD 41 to 54. Born to Drusus and Antonia Minor at Lugdunum in Roman Gaul, where his father was stationed as a military legate, he was the first Roman emperor to be born outside Italy. Nonetheless, Claudius was an Italic of Sabine origins and a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his consulship, shared with his nephew Caligula in 37. Claudius's infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of Tiberius' and Caligula's reigns; potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. His survival led to his being declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last man of his family. Despite his lack of experience, Claudius proved to be an able and efficient administrator. He expanded the imperial bureaucracy to include freedmen, and helped to restore the empire's finances after the excess of Caligula's reign. He was also an ambitious builder, constructing many new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Empire. During his reign the Empire started its successful conquest of Britain. Having a personal interest in law, he presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day. He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, particularly by elements of the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position; this resulted in the deaths of many senators. These events damaged his reputation among the ancient writers, though more recent historians have revised this opinion. Many authors contend that he was murdered by his own wife. After his death in 54 (at the age of 63), his grand-nephew, step-son, and adopted son Nero succeeded him as emperor. His 13-year reign (slightly longer than Nero's) would not be surpassed by any successors until that of Domitian, who reigned for 15 years. He was a descendant of the Octavii Rufi (through Gaius Octavius), Julii Caesares (through Julia Minor and Julia Antonia), and the Claudii Nerones (through Nero Claudius Drusus).

{"title": "Otto von Habsburg", "passage": "Otto von Habsburg (20 November 1912 4 July 2011), also known by his traditional royal title of Archduke Otto of Austria, was the last Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary from 1916 until the dissolution of the empire in 1919, a realm which comprised modern-day Austria, Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, and parts of Italy, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine. He became the pretender to the former thrones, Head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, and Sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1922, upon the death of his father. He resigned as Sovereign of the Golden Fleece in 2000 and as head of the Imperial House in 2007. The eldest son of Charles I and IV, the last Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, and his wife, Zita of Bourbon-Parma, Otto was born as third in line to the thrones, as Archduke Otto of Austria, Royal Prince of Hungary, Bohemia, and Croatia. With his father's accession to the thrones in 1916, he was likely to become emperor and king. As his father never abdicated, Otto was considered by himself, his family and Austro-Hungarian legitimists to be the rightful emperor-king from 1922. Otto was active on the Austrian and European political stage from the 1930s, both by promoting the cause of Habsburg restoration and as an early proponent of European integration—being thoroughly disgusted with nationalism—and a fierce opponent of Nazism and communism. He has been described as one of the leaders of the Austrian Resistance. After the 1938 \"Anschluss\", where monarchists were severely persecuted in Austria and sentenced to death by the Nazis, Otto fled Europe to the United States. Otto von Habsburg was Vice President (1957–1973) and President (1973–2004) of the International Paneuropean Union, and served as a Member of the European Parliament for the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU) from 1979 to 1999. As a newly elected Member of the European Parliament in 1979, Otto had an empty chair set up for the countries on the other side of the Iron Curtain in the European Parliament, and took a strong interest in the countries behind the Iron Curtain. Otto von Habsburg played a notable role in the revolutions of 1989, as a co-initiator of the Pan-European Picnic. Later he was a strong supporter of the EU membership of central and eastern European countries. A noted intellectual, he published several books on historical and political affairs. Otto has been described as one of the \"architects of the European idea and of European integration\" together with Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer, and Alcide De Gasperi. Otto was exiled in 1919 and grew up mostly in Spain. His devout Catholic mother raised him according to the old curriculum of Austria-Hungary, preparing him to become a Catholic monarch. During his life in exile, he lived in Switzerland, Madeira, Spain, Belgium, France, the United States, and from 1954 until his death, finally in Bavaria (Germany), in the residence \"Villa Austria\". At the time of his death, he was a citizen of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Croatia ,having earlier been stateless \"de jure\" and \"de facto\", and possessed passports of Monaco, the Order of Malta, and Spain. His funeral took place at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna on 16 July 2011; he was entombed in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna and his heart buried in Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary.", "qa":

{"title": "Henry IV of France", "passage": "Henry IV (read as ; 13 December 1553 – 14 May 1610), also known by the epithet Good King Henry or Henry the Great, was King of Navarre (as Henry III) from 1572 and King of France from 1589 to 1610. He was the first monarch of France from the House of Bourbon, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty. He was assassinated in 1610 by François Ravaillac, a fanatical Catholic, and was succeeded by his son Louis XIII. The son of Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme and Jeanne d'Albret, the Queen of Navarre, Henry was baptised as a Catholic but raised in the Protestant faith by his mother. He inherited the throne of Navarre in 1572 on his mother's death. As a Huguenot, Henry was involved in the French Wars of Religion, barely escaping assassination in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. He later led Protestant forces against the royal army. He and his predecessor Henry III of France were direct descendants of Saint-King Louis IX. Henry III belonged to the House of Valois, descended from Philip III of France, elder son of Saint Louis; Henry IV belonged to the House of Bourbon, descended from Robert, Count of Clermont, younger son of Saint Louis. As Head of the House of Bourbon, Henry was \"first prince of the blood\". Upon the death of his brother-in-law and distant cousin Henry III in 1589, Henry was called to the French succession by the Salic law. He initially kept the Protestant faith (the only French king to do so) and had to fight against the Catholic League, which denied that he could wear France's crown as a Protestant. To obtain mastery over his kingdom, after four years of stalemate, he found it prudent to abjure the Calvinist faith. As a pragmatic politician (in the parlance of the time, a \"politique\"), he displayed an unusual religious tolerance for the era. Notably, he promulgated the Edict of Nantes (1598), which guaranteed religious liberties to Protestants, thereby effectively ending the Wars of Religion. Considered a usurper by some Catholics and a traitor by some Protestants, Henry became target of at least 12 assassination attempts. An unpopular king among his contemporaries, Henry gained more status after his death. He was admired for his repeated victories over his enemies and his conversion to Catholicism. The \"Good King Henryle bon roi Henri\") was remembered for his geniality and his great concern about the welfare of his subjects. An active ruler, he worked to regularise state finance, promote agriculture, eliminate corruption and encourage education. During his reign, the French colonization of the Americas truly began with the foundation of the colony of Acadia and its capital Port-Royal. He was celebrated in the popular song \"Vive le roi Henri\" (which later became an anthem for the French monarchy during the reigns of his successors) and in Voltaire's \"Henriade\".", "qa":

{"title": "Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor", "passage": "Henry IV (11 November 1050 – 7 August 1106) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1084 to 1105, king of Germany from 1054 to 1105, king of Italy and Burgundy from 1056 to 1105, and duke of Bavaria from 1052 to 1054. He was the son of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, and Agnes of Poitou. After his father's death on 5 October 1056, Henry was placed under his mother's guardianship. She made grants to German aristocrats to secure their support. Unlike her late husband, she could not control the election of the popes, thus the idea of the \"freedom of the church\" strengthened during her rule. Taking advantage of her weakness, Archbishop Anno II of Cologne kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of age in 1065. Henry decided to recover the royal estates that had been lost during his minority. He employed low-ranking officials to carry out his new policies, causing discontent in Saxony and Thuringia. Henry crushed a riot in Saxony in 1069 and overcame the rebellion of the Saxon aristocrat, Otto of Nordheim in 1071. The appointment of commoners to high offices offended German aristocrats, and many of them withdrew from Henry's court. He insisted on his royal prerogatives relating to the appointment of bishops and abbots, although the reformist clerics condemned this practice as simony (a forbidden sale of church offices). Pope Alexander II blamed Henry's advisors for his acts and excommunicated them in early 1073. Henry's conflicts with the Holy See and the German dukes weakened his position and the Saxons rose up again in the summer of 1074. He took advantage of a rift between the Saxon aristocrats and peasantry and forced the rebels into submission in October 1075. Henry adopted an active policy in Italy, alarming Pope Gregory VII who threatened him with excommunication for simony. Henry persuaded most of the German bishops to declare the Pope's election invalid on 24 January 1076. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects of allegiance. To prevent the Pope from sitting in judgement on him at the German leaders' assembly, Henry went to Italy. His penitential \"Walk to Canossa\" was a success. Gregory VII had no choice but to absolve him in January 1077. Henry's German opponents ignored his absolution and elected an antiking, Rudolf of Rheinfelden, on 14 March 1077. The Pope was initially neutral in the two kings' conflict, enabling Henry to consolidate his position. Henry continued to appoint high-ranking clerics, for which the Pope again excommunicated him on 7 March 1080. Most German and Lombardian bishops remained loyal to Henry and they elected an antipope, Clement III. Rudolf of Rheinfelden was killed in battle and his successor, Hermann of Salm, could only exert royal authority in Saxony. From 1081, Henry launched a series of military campaigns to Italy, and Clement III crowned him emperor in Rome on 1 April 1084. Hermann of Salm died and Henry pacified Saxony with the local aristocrats' assistance in 1088. He launched an invasion against the pope's principal Italian ally, Matilda of Tuscany, in 1089. She convinced Henry's elder son, Conrad, to take up arms against his father in 1093. Her alliance with Welf I, Duke of Bavaria prevented Henry's return to Germany until 1096 when he was reconciled with Welf. After Clement III's death, Henry did not support new antipopes, but he did not make peace with Pope Paschal II. Henry proclaimed the first \"Landfrieden\" (or imperial peace) which covered the whole territory of Germany in 1103. His younger son, Henry V, forced him to abdicate on 31 December 1105. He tried to regain his throne with the assistance of Lotharingian aristocrats, but became ill and died without receiving absolution from his excommunication.", "qa": [{"question": "When was Henry IV,

{"title": "Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer", "passage": "Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer (before 103 BC or c. 100 BC – 59 BC) was a consul in 60 BC and son of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos, or, according to some, the son of Tribune Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer while the latter is the son of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos. Previously he held the offices of Praetor and Augur in 63 BC. During the Third Mithridatic War (73-63 BC) against Mithridates VI of Pontus and Tigranes the Great of Armenia, Metellus Celer was a lieutenant (legate) of Pompey during his eastern campaigns (66-63 BC). In the winter of 66 BC Oroeses, king of the Caucasian Albanians attacked the forces of Pompey while they were celebrating the festival of the Saturnalia in their winter quarters in Lesser Armenia. Pompey had split his army into three divisions. Metellus Celer was in charge of one of them and custodian of Tigranes the Younger of Armenia. Metellus vigorously repulsed Oroeses while Flaccus and Pompey, who were in charge of the other two divisions, defeated the other Albanians. In 63 BC, when the Catilinarian Conspiracy was discovered Catiline, its leader, was indicted for violence. He went to stay at the house of Metellus Celer to allay suspicions as Metellus was the praetor, but was unsuccessful. Metellus then brought several conspirators to trial by virtue of a decree of the senate and imprisoned them. Cicero entrusted matters outside Rome to Metellus Celer. He was sent to the district of Pisa (in Etruria) with three legions. On learning that the rebels were advancing towards Pistoia to flee to Cisalpine Gaul (in northern Italy) he encamped at the foot of the mountain from which they had to descend for their passage to Cisalpine Gaul, while the consul Antonius had his troops at their rear. He besieged Faesulae (Fiesole), the base of Catiline, together with Antonius. The two men were encamped in two different places. Catiline attacked Antonius instead of Metellus, even through the former had a larger army. References to Metellus Celer during the conspiracy were also made by Cicero and Valerius Maximus. When he was consul in 60 BC Metellus Celer sided with the Optimates and vigorously opposed Pompey in everything because he had divorced his sister. Together with Cato the Younger he was the main opponent of the ratification of the acts Pompey had made with the cities and kingdoms in Asia as a result of the Mithridatic War. He also opposed an agrarian bill proposed by Flavius, a plebeian tribune, which Pompey sponsored and which was intended to give land grants to Pompey's discharged soldiers which they were entitled to. Metellus led the opposition to the agrarian bill. He contested every point of Flavius' bill and attacked him so persistently that the plebeian tribune had him put in prison. Metellus wanted to convene the senate there and Flavius sat at the entrance of the cell to prevent this. Metellus had the wall cut through to let them in. When Pompey heard this he was afraid of the reaction of the people and told Flavius to desist. Metellus did not consent when the other plebeian tribunes wanted to set him free. In 59 BC Metellus Celer and Cato the Younger for a time refused to swear obedience to the agrarian law of Julius Caesar, who was consul in that year. Eventually they complied. During Metellus Celer’s praetorship, Titus Labienus indicted an old backbench Optimate senator, Gaius Rabirius, for the murder of Lucius Appuleius Saturninus thirty-six years earlier. Saturninus had been opposed by the consuls of the time at the direction of the senate. Thus, with the proposed trial the senate would lose the authority to enforce its decrees. Acts which had received the approval of the senate and had been committed many years earlier tended to give immunity to those who tried to repeat the conduct of Saturninus and make punishment of such acts ineffective. The senate was outraged that an innocent elderly man of senatorial rank was attacked and that the tribunes were entrusted with the control of affairs. There were pro- and anti-prosecution factions. The former won through the support of Julius Caesar, who was the judge together with Lucius Julius Caesar, and Rabirius was charged. The judges had been unlawfully chosen by the urban praetor, Lentulus Sura, instead of the people. Rabirius appealed and would have been convicted by the people, but this was prevented by Metellus by obstructing the meeting of the assembly of the people. Metellus Celer was married to his cousin Clodia Quadrantaria, often referred to in scholarship as Clodia Metelli (\"Clodia the wife of Metellus\"), the daughter of Appius Claudius Pulcher. They had a daughter named Caecilia Metella, like all the women in the family of the Caecilii Metelli. Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer died suddenly in 59 BC--according to some poisoned by his wife, who was notoriously debauched, reputed to be the incestuous lover of her brother Clodius, of Caelius,

{"title": "Pontus De la Gardie", "passage": "Baron Pontus De la Gardie (ca. 1520 – 5 November 1585) was a French nobleman and general in the service of Denmark and Sweden. He was born Ponce d'Escouperie in Caunes-Minervois (Aude), Languedoc, a son of Jacques Escoperier and X Armengaud. As a youngster, he wanted to become a priest and was educated in a monastery. He changed his mind however, and left Languedoc to become a mercenary in the service of Denmark. De la Gardie was promoted to officer and was in charge of a regiment of mercenaries. In 1565, during the Northern Seven Years' War, he was captured by Swedish troops at Varberg, and changed allegiance to Sweden. De la Gardie quickly became a favourite of John III of Sweden and in 1569, after only four years in the Swedish service, he received noble status. In 1571, he was created a baron and was given Ekholmen Castle. He was suspected to have taken part in a plot to assassinate John III. The plot was led by Charles de Mornay, who was in contact with Christina of Denmark and the French ambassador in Copenhagen Charles Dancay. John III was to be killed during a swords dance performed by Scottish mercenaries at the party which was to be given in October that year before the Scottish mercenaries departure to the Baltic. After the assassination, the king's brother Duke Charles was to be placed upon the throne. The plot did not materialize as de Mornay lost his nerve and never gave the sign to the mercenaries to take action. In September 1574, the plot was revealed and Charles de Mornay was arrested, interrogated and executed. It was never made clear who participated in the plot. However, it is noted, that the suspected conspirators Hogenskild Bielke, Gustaf Banér and Pontus De la Gardie, often gathered at meetings in the apartment of Princess Elizabeth of Sweden, meetings where Princess Cecilia of Sweden had also frequently been seen, and the two sisters and their brother Charles were somewhat compromised though they were never accused. Pontus De la Gardie was himself never put on trial for his suspected involvement in the affair. After Clas Åkesson Tott's resignation as the supreme commander of the Swedish forces in Finland and Estonia as a consequence of the Siege of Wesenberg (1574) during the Livonian War, de la Gardie took over Tott's office. De la Gardie's skills combined with the fact that Sweden's enemy Russia had to transfer troops to defend against Polish attacks further south led to considerable military success for Sweden during the following years. In the fall of 1580, Karelia was conquered. De la Gardie led his troops over the frozen Gulf of Finland to capture the fortresses of Wesenberg (now Rakvere) and Tolsburg (now Toolse). In September 1581, Narva was taken after a storming that had been preceded by a massive bombardment. 4,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, pointing out the fact that De la Gardie was not only a skillful warrior, but a cruel and hard commander as well. De la Gardie and his Swedish troops went on to capture the fortress of Ivangorod and several other fortresses that autumn. In 1582, the war with Russia was ended and Sweden got to keep the conquests made in Karelia and Ingria, but had to withdraw from Livonia. De la Gardie was the most renowned military commander in Sweden during the 16th century and has been credited with much of the country's military success in the 1580s. An example of his ingenuity was the strategy of using zigzag shaped saps during the siege of Narva, a new technique at the time.

{"title": "The Devil in Miss Jones", "passage": "The Devil in Miss Jones is a 1973 pornographic film, written, directed and produced by Gerard Damiano and starring Georgina Spelvin and Harry Reems. It is widely regarded as a classic adult film, released during the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984). After his 1972 success with \"Deep Throat\", Damiano shot the film in a converted apple-packing plant in Milanville, Pennsylvania. Along with \"Deep Throat\" and \"Behind the Green Door\", the film is associated with a time in American culture known as \"porno chic\", in which adult erotic films were just beginning to be widely released, publicly discussed by celebrities (like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope) and taken seriously by film critics (like Roger Ebert).

{"title": "Alex de Renzy", "passage": "Alexander de Renzy( August 13, 1935 – June 8, 2001) was an American director and producer of pornographic movies. Born in New York City, de Renzy served in the United States Air Force as a Survival Instructor. Back in the United States, he began making documentary films in San Francisco. In October 1969, he went to Denmark to attend\" Sex 69\", the first porn trade show hosted in Copenhagen after the legalization of adult pornography there. This resulted in his first movie,\" Censorship in Denmark: A New Approach\"( 1970), which was released the following year. He was the editor on\" Sexual Encounter Group\"( 1970), was a cinematographer on seven movies, and wrote five screenplays. His production\" Lady Freaks\"( 1973) introduced porn star legend Annette Haven. His films also include the two 1970s porn classics\" Babyface\"( 1977) and\" Pretty Peaches\"( 1978). Another de Renzy discovery was Desireé Cousteau. She won the Adult Film Association of America Award in 1978 for\" Best Actress\" for her starring role in\" Pretty Peaches\" and became an international sex star. The plot of\" Pretty Peaches\" derives from Voltaire's literary classic\" Candide\" about a naive young woman undergoing a series of hardships which constitute the satire. \" Peaches\" contains a notorious enema scene( and for a time was censored from the VHS release, restored in Alpha Blue's DVD release) in which the powerful jet- spray from Cousteau's hindquarters knocks the administering physician to the bathroom floor, to which Peaches bemoans\" I do n't think he could cure anything!\" A third actress de Renzy introduced to adult films was Juliet Anderson, better known as\" Aunt Peg\". He won the Adult Film Association of America Award in 1977 for Best Director for\" Babyface\", and was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame and the XRCO Hall of Fame. After filming his final story- driven works,\" Slave to Love\" and\" Two Women\", de Renzy reinvented himself as Rex Borsky in 1991.

{"title": "Jack Clayton", "passage": "Jack Clayton (1 March 1921 – 26 February 1995) was a British film director and producer who specialised in bringing literary works to the screen. Starting out as a teenage studio \"tea boy\" in 1935, Clayton worked his way up through British film industry in a career that spanned nearly sixty years. He rapidly rose through a series of increasingly important roles in British film production, before shooting to international prominence as a director with his Oscar-winning feature film debut, the drama \"Room at the Top\" (1959); this was followed by the much-lauded horror film \"The Innocents\" (1961), adapted from Henry James' \"The Turn of the Screw\". Clayton looked set for a brilliant future, and he was highly regarded by peers and critics alike, but a number of overlapping factors hampered his career. He was a notably 'choosy' director, who by his own admission \"never made a film I didn't want to make\", and he repeatedly turned down films (including \"Alien\") that became huge hits for other directors. But he was also dogged by bad luck and bad timing - the Hollywood studios labelled him as 'difficult', and studio politics quashed a string of planned films in the 1970s, which were either taken out of his hands, or cancelled in the final stages of preparation. In 1977, he suffered a double blow - his current film was cancelled just two weeks before shooting was due to begin, and a few months later he suffered a serious stroke which robbed him of the ability to speak, and put his career on hold for five years. Despite his relatively small \"oeuvre\", the films of Jack Clayton continue to be appreciated, and both they and their director have been widely admired and praised by leading film critics like Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert, and by film industry peers including Harold Pinter, Martin Scorsese, Guillermo del Toro, François Truffaut, Tennessee Williams and Steven Spielberg.", "qa": [{"question": "Who was Jack Clayton?", "answer": "Jack Clayton was a British film director and producer who specialised in bringing literary works to the screen."}, {"question": "When was Jack Clayton born?", "answer": "Jack Clayton was born on 1 March 1921."}, {"question": "When did Jack Clayton pass away?", "answer": "Jack Clayton passed away on 26 February 1995."}, {"question": "What was Jack Clayton's first prominent film as a director?", "answer": "Jack Clayton's first prominent film as a director was the drama 'Room at the Top' (1959), which won an Oscar."}, {"question": "What genre was the film 'The Innocents'?", "answer": "'The Innocents' was a horror film."}, {"question": "What literary work was 'The Innocents' adapted from?", "answer": "'The Innocents' was adapted from Henry James' 'The Turn of the Screw'."}, {"question": "What factors hampered Jack Clayton's career?", "answer": "Jack Clayton's career was hampered by factors such as being a 'choosy' director, bad luck, bad timing, being labelled as 'difficult' by Hollywood studios, and studio politics."}, {"question": "What film did Jack Clayton turn down that became a huge hit?", "answer": "Jack Clayton turned down the film 'Alien', which became a huge hit for another director."}, {"question": "What happened to Jack Clayton's career in the 1970s?", "answer": "In the 1970s, Jack Clayton had a string of planned films either taken out of his hands or cancelled in the final stages of preparation due to studio politics."}, {"question": "What event in 1977 severely impacted Jack Clayton's career?", "answer": "In 1977, Jack Clayton suffered a serious stroke, which robbed him of the ability to speak and put his career on hold for five years."}, {"question": "What was the state of Jack Clayton's career after his stroke?", "answer": "After his stroke, Jack Clayton's career was put on hold for five years."}, {"question": "How was Jack Clayton regarded by peers and critics?", "answer": "Jack Clayton was highly regarded by peers and critics alike."}, {"question": "Who are some of the film critics and industry peers who admired Jack Clayton?", "answer": "Some of the film critics and industry peers who admired Jack Clayton include Pauline Kael, Roger Ebert, Harold Pinter, Martin Scorsese, Guillermo del Toro, François Truffaut, Tennessee Williams, and Steven Spielberg."}, {"question": "What type of director was Jack Clayton described as?", "answer": "Jack Clayton was described as a notably 'choosy' director who 'never made a film I didn't want to make'."}, {"question": "What was Jack Clayton's role in the British film industry before becoming a director?", "answer": "Before becoming a director, Jack Clayton worked as a teenage studio 'tea boy' in 1935."}, {"question": "How long did Jack Clayton's career span?", "answer": "Jack Clayton's career spanned nearly sixty years."}, {"question": "What was Jack Clayton's relationship with Hollywood studios?", "answer": "Jack Clayton was labelled as 'difficult' by Hollywood studios, which impacted his career."}, {"question": "What is the significance of Jack Clayton's 'oeuvre'?", "answer": "Despite his relatively small 'oeuvre', the films of Jack Clayton continue to be appreciated, and both they and their director have been widely admired."}]}

{"title": "My Own Private Idaho", "passage": "My Own Private Idaho is a 1991 American independent adventure drama film written and directed by Gus Van Sant, loosely based on Shakespeare's\" Henry IV, Part 1 Henry IV, Part 2\", and\" Henry V\", and starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves. The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland, Oregon to Mike's hometown in Idaho, and then to Rome in search of Mike's mother. Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechy's 1963 novel\" City of Night\" and concluding that Rechy's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott's story as a modern update of the\" Henry IV\" plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. After he sent copies of his script to Reeves, and Reeves then showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film on each other's behalf. \" My Own Private Idaho\" had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of\" The New York Times\" and\" Entertainment Weekly\". The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over$ 6.4 million in North America, above its estimated budget of$ 2.5 million. Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards, and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics. \" My Own Private Idaho\" is considered a landmark film in the New Queer Cinema movement, an early 1990s movement in queer- themed independent filmmaking. Since its 1991 release, the film has grown in popularity and been deemed as a cult classic, especially among LGBT audiences.

In 2003, Van Sant's film about the Columbine High School massacre, \"Elephant\", won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Van Sant also received the festival's Best Director Award that same year, making him one of only two filmmakers—the other being Joel Coen—to win both accolades at the festival in the same year. Though most of Van Sant's other films received favourable reviews, such as \"Finding Forrester\" (2000) and \"Paranoid Park\" (2007), some of his efforts, such as the art house production \"Last Days\" (2005) and the environmental drama \"Promised Land\" (2012), have received more mixed reviews from critics, while his adaptation of Tom Robbins's \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" (1994), his 1998 remake of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\", and \"The Sea of Trees\" (2015), were critical and commercial failures. In addition to directing, Van Sant has written the screenplays for several of his earlier works, and is the author of a novel entitled \"Pink\".

{"title": "Elmer Clifton", "passage": "Elmer Clifton( March 14, 1890 – October 15, 1949) was an American writer, director and actor from the early silent days. A collaborator of D.W. Griffith, he appeared in\" The Birth of a Nation\"( 1915) and\" Intolerance\"( 1916) before giving up acting in 1917 to concentrate on work behind the camera, with Griffith and Joseph Henabery as his mentors. His first feature- length solo effort as a director was\" The Flame of Youth\" with Jack Mulhall. Clifton honed his talents during the late 1910s, directing vehicles for Mulhall and Herbert Rawlinson at Universal and then for Dorothy Gish for Famous Players- Lasky. Two of his projects with Gish,\" Nobody Home\" and\" Nugget Nell\", featured performances from pre-stardom Rudolph Valentino. Most of this early output has been lost. He was the first filmmaker to discover the talents of Clara Bow, whom he cast in\" Down to the Sea in Ships\", released on March 4, 1923. The independently produced film was well reviewed for its visual authenticity. During the 1920s, Clifton directed films for several different studios. During the filming of\" The Warrens of Virginia\"( 1924) for Fox Film Corporation, lead actress Martha Mansfield suffered a fatal accident from burns when her costume caught fire. Clifton directed\" The Wreck of the Hesperus\" for Cecil B. deMille's production company, and filmed on location in the Grand Canyon for\" The Bride of the Colorado\". He also directed some Technicolor short films, including\" Manchu Love\" with an all- Asian cast. In the sound era, Clifton wrote and directed many poverty row Westerns and\" exploitation\" classics, among them the anti-marijuana polemic\" Assassin of Youth\"( 1937).

He directed a version of\" The Unknown Soldier\" in 1985, 30 years after Edvin Laine directed the original version of it. Mollberg's movie's plot was same as Laine's movie. But Mollberg used unknown actors and the movie was colourised and shot by a handhold camera. Mollberg did not begin directing films for the cinema until he was well into his forties. He made a notable splash on the international festival circuit in 1974 with\" The Earth Is A Sinful Song\"( 1973), his debut feature, an earthy, erotically- charged, blood- soaked tale of a young village girl's ill- fated affair with a Lapp reindeer herdsman. Based on a novel by the late Timo K. Mukka, one of Finland's most controversial young writers, the film\" stunned Scandinavian critics and audiences alike with its simple, terrible power and its authentic sensuality\"( Peter Cowie), and went on to become one of the biggest box- office successes in the Finnish cinema's history. It also introduced Mollberg's trademark style:\" a realistic naturalism full of expressive force with which he merges the people with the scenery, stripping them bare of life's illusions and the polished veneer of culture\"( Sakari Toiviainen). Despite Peter Cowie's efforts, and the acclaim of many other critics and\" independent\" festivals, The Finnish National Film board has stubbornly sequestered this masterpiece, only releasing it in a DVD format incompatible with international viewing, and lacking English subtitles. During his career he was used to get wide audiences in Finland. His film\" The Earth is a Sinful Song\"( 1973) sold 709,664 tickets and it is 11th on the list of most admissions to a Finnish film. 590,271 tickets were sold for the screenings of\" The Unknown Soldier\"( 1985) making it the 17th highest- grossing movie in the history of Finland.", "qa": null}
