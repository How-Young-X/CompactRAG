Alongside Lincoln Thompson, \"preps\" Lewis, and Devon Russell, Cedric Myton formed \"The Tartans\" in 1968, the group released many 45\" singles, and had early success in 1969 with the hit 45 \"Dance All Night\".  After a couple of years The Tartans disbanded, and Myton alongside Lincoln \"Prince\" Thompson, formed \"The Royal Rasses\".  Cedric Myton spent almost 3 years alongside Thompson, writing the tracks which would constitute the Royal Rasses album \"Humanity\".  Cedric Myton also sang on every track on the album \"Humanity\".  This album was a big success, although Cedric Myton left The Royal Rasses shortly after the release of \"Humanity\", his beautiful falsetto tones on every track, undoubtedly brought many fans to the attention of \"The Royal Rasses\" and the band continued without Cedric Myton, who went on to form \"The Congos\", alongside Roydel Johnson, who had a rich \"tenor\" and Watty Burnett who provided a \"Deep Barritone\", which combined with Cedric Mytons rich \"Falsetto\" anchored The Congos, whose music is easily distinguishable and highly regarded in not just reggae circles but worldwide.  Unfortunately, due to both a dispute between the producer Lee\"Scratch\"Perry and Island Records favouritism of Bob Marley,the great first release LP from The Congos \"Heart Of The Congos\" was \"Shelved\" because it was deemed \"a strong album\" and Island Records.led by Chris Blackwell felt \"Heart Of The Congos\" would take away the limelight from Bob Marley.  Many years later the English group \"The Beat\" released \"Heart Of The Congos\" on their own \"Go-Feat\" label, as did the company \"Blood And Fire\", and \"Heart Of The Congos\" was a big success,and rightly so, however it has to be said that had the album been released when it was first recorded it would have been a massive success.

They tend to be associated with wet soils, many growing in shallow water, in wetlands, or in wet savannas like flatwoods.  In wet soils, their abundance appears to be related to water levels, fire frequency, and competition from other plants such as grasses.  Experiments have shown that they are weak competitors compared to many other wetland plant species.  Some species can persist as buried seeds during unfavorable conditions.

Except for mainstays, Jones and Perkins, the line-up has changed as the group splintered and reformed several times.  Their debut album, \"The Axeman's Jazz\" (July 1984), was the best selling Australian alternative rock album for 1984.  Their debut single, \"Psycho\", is a cover version of the Leon Payne original, and was the best selling Australian alternative rock single for that year.  However the group disbanded by mid-1985 and each member pursued other musical projects.  They reformed in 1987 and issued a second album, \"Sour Mash\", in December 1988 on Red Eye Records.  According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, it \"virtually redefined the parameters of guitar-based rock'n'roll.  The Cramps-influenced swamp-rock of old had been discarded for a more adventurous slab of gutbucket blues and avant-garde weirdness.  Perkins' voice had matured into an authentic blues growl\".  Their fifth studio album, \"Gone\" (January 1997), reached the Top 50 ARIA Albums Chart.

People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.", "meta": {"title": "M", "id": "u"}, "score": 0.26418402791023254}, {"text": "passage title: Music of Ohio\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame are located in Cleveland, Ohio.

Although Ian believe that he is much more fit to rule the Cahills that Amy and Dan, it seems that the Cahills do not fully recognize Ian as the leader.

The leader of the coup is the Outcast, and he plans to replicate history's worst disasters in order to test Cahill leadership.  The Cahills are expected to prevent the disasters in order to prove that they are worthy.

It's also known as Cipó Preto (black liana), Pagode caipira (rural pagode) or Pagode sertanejo (folk pagode).  Sertanejo means anything that comes from the back-country, outback or simply the countryside.  This style of music was pioneered by musicians Tião Carreiro and Lourival dos Santos in the late 1950s, when they fused the \"Coco\" and \"Calango de roda\" rhythms.  Although other instruments can be added, it is much characterized by its simple, acoustic approach, with the use of just one or two viola guitars, often accompanied by an acoustic guitar and, at times, a light percussion section.  A structural feature commonly used in this genre is the alternation of verses sung with the accompaniement of a classical guitar, with solos of viola caipira.  Pieces can be entirely instrumental or have one or two singers, usually: when there are two lead vocals (that can be men, women or a combination), they sing together on a steady interval.  The metrics used are usually of five or seven-syllable roundels, and in presentations, songs quite often are linked together, on a medley.  Another notable feature are its lyrics, that tend to portray the everyday life of country people, telling stories about simple life, nature, love, booze, animals and so on.", "meta": {"title": "P", "id": "a"}, "score": 0.26037123799324036}, {"text": "passage title: XHamster\nxHamster is a pornographic media and social networking site headquartered in Limassol, Cyprus.  xHamster serves user-submitted pornographic videos, webcam models, pornographic photographs, and erotic literature, and incorporates social networking features.  xHamster was founded in 2007.

Tradition history seeks to analyze biblical literature in terms of the process by which biblical traditions passed from stage to stage into their final form, especially how they passed from oral tradition to written form.  Tradition history/criticism is a sister discipline of form criticism—also associated with Gunkel, who used the results of source and form criticism to develop the history of tradition interpretation.  Form criticism and tradition criticism thus overlap, though the former is more narrow in focus.  Tradition history is connected with secular folklore studies, especially Axel Olrik's analysis of Scandinavian folklore and the \"laws\" which he established concerning the nature of such folklore.

The term was first adapted into sociology from the theatre by Erving Goffman, who developed most of the related terminology and ideas in his 1959 book, \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\".  Kenneth Burke, whom Goffman would later acknowledge as an influence, had earlier presented his notions of dramatism in 1945, which in turn derives from Shakespeare.  However, the fundamental difference between Burke's and Goffman's view is that Burke believed that life was in fact theatre, whereas Goffman viewed theatre as a metaphor.  If we imagine ourselves as directors observing what goes on in the theatre of everyday life, we are doing what Goffman called dramaturgical analysis, the study of social interaction in terms of theatrical performance.", "meta": {"title": "D", "id": "r"}, "score": 0.2990676164627075}, {"text": "passage title: What the Water Gave Me (painting)\nWhat the Water Gave Me (\"Lo que el agua me dio\" in Spanish) is an oil painting by Frida Kahlo that was completed in 1938.

In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.

The title is a reference to Thomas Jefferson's quotation, \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\"  The idea began in 2003 as \"The Cuba Project\", which was to include classic protest and folk songs recorded in Cuba.  In 2008 the album was finally recorded but in California.  About half of the songs planned for The Cuba Project were used on the final cut, with other songs coming from Jefferson Starship's previous repertoire and another project band member Paul Kantner had planned called \"On the Threshold of Fire.\"  The promotional tour for the album began in late June with shows at Larkspur, California followed by tours in the US and Europe before the album's release, and continued through December 2008 with a further tour in the US and a tour in Japan.  On February 1, 2009, more tour dates and venues were announced by the band's manager Michael Gaiman, with additional plans to continue the tour through 2010 and bring it to Australia and South America.  David Grisman joined the band for the April 2009 tour dates.

At the same time, the NHL emerged as the only major league and the sole competitor for the Stanley Cup; in 1947, the NHL completed a deal with the Stanley Cup trustees to gain full control of the Cup.

The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas.  With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada.  Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.  A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation.  Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949.  Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.  This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom, and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Main characters are a student, who has returned to his home in Nouadhibou, an electrician and his child apprentice, and the local women.  The film is characterized by a succession of scenes of the daily life of the characters which are unique to their particular African and Arab cultures, while borrowing from tropes of Tayeb Saleh's Season of Migration to the North (موسم الهجرة إلى الشمال).  The viewer must interpret the scenes without much help from narrator or plot, while the structure of the film hangs on a series of mundane but visually arresting moments, many of which are repeated in other works in Abderrahmane Sissako's opus, including scenes at a barber shop and a photo booth, also present in his earlier La Vie Sur Terre and later Timbuktu.  The film presents typical Mauritanian moments of beauty, struggle, alienation, and humor, which are experienced by groups socially divided from each other, such as Bidhan women drinking tea and gossiping, West African migrants passing through Mauritania to get to Europe (and finding an unsuccessful comrade washed ashore).  The young protagonist who has returned interacts with all of these groups as an outsider, as he struggles to remember even his own Hassaniya Arabic dialect, but prefers instead French.

Despite the smaller size of the resort, which is considerably smaller than neighbouring resorts such as Big White Ski Resort and Silver Star Mountain Resort, the mountain is of good size and is a popular destination for both experienced and first-time skiers, snowboarders and snowshoers.  Despite the lower elevation, the resort receives heavy snowfall each year with many powder days throughout the winter season.  It was long known as Last Mountain Ski Resort but has since changed its name to Crystal Mountain Resort in 1992.  Crystal Mountain Resort offers lessons for skiing and snowboarding as well as offering rentals for snowshoeing.

From the 1990s, there was a decline, partly because many of its members were unable to do serious teamwork; and partly because the dogmatic style of Magan Desai, a powerful figure in the strongest state unit, Gujarat, clashed with other members who wanted a more open and non-sectarian functioning.
