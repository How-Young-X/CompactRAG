It is a famous Music school named after the famous Hungarian composer Béla Bartók. It was founded in 1966.\n\npassage title: List of compositions by Béla Bartók\nThis aspires to be a complete list of compositions by Béla Bartók.  The catalogue numbering by András Szőllősy (Sz.) , László Somfai (BB.)  and Denijs Dille (DD.)  are provided, as well as Bartók's own opus numbers.  Note that Bartók started three times anew with opus numbers, here indicated with \"(list 1)\", \"(list 2)\" and \"(list 3)\" respectively.  The pieces from the third listing are by far best known; opus lists 1 and 2 are early works.  The year of composition and instrumentation (including voice) are included.  See the main article on Béla Bartók for more details.\n\npassage title: Béla Bartók\nBéla Viktor János Bartók ( ; ] ; 25 March 1881 – 26 September 1945) was a Hungarian composer, pianist and an ethnomusicologist.  He is considered one of the most important composers of the 20th century; he and Liszt are regarded as Hungary's greatest composers .  Through his collection and analytical study of folk music, he was one of the founders of comparative musicology, which later became ethnomusicology.\n\npassage title: Suite, Op. 14 (Bartók)\nThe Suite, Op. 14, Sz.  62, BB 70 is a piece for solo piano written by Béla Bartók.  It was written in February 1916, published in 1918, and debuted by the composer on April 21, 1919, in Budapest.  The Suite is one of Bartók's most significant works for piano, only comparable with his 1926 Piano Sonata.  Though much of Bartók's work makes frequent use of Eastern European folk music, this suite is one of the few pieces without melodies of folk origin.  However, Romanian, Arabic, and North African rhythmic influences can still be found in some movements.  Originally intending the suite to be a five-movement work, Bartók later decided against the idea and discarded the second movement, the \"Andante\", which was published only posthumously in the October 1955 issue of \"Új Zenei Szemle\" (New Musical Review).\n\npassage title: List of string quartets by Béla Bartók\nThe Hungarian composer Béla Bartók wrote six string quartets, each for the usual forces of two violins, viola and cello.  Notable composers who have been influenced by them include Benjamin Britten, particularly in the Sonata in C for Cello and Piano (; ), Elliott Carter, who refers in the opening of his own First String Quartet to Bartók’s Sixth Quartet , Chen Yi , Edison Denisov, whose Second Quartet is closely related to Bartók’s Fifth Quartet , Franco Donatoni, who was deeply impressed when he heard a broadcast of Bartók's Fourth Quartet , Robert Fripp, who mentions them as an influence upon King Crimson , Miloslav Ištvan , György Kurtág, whose Opp.  1 and 28 both owe a great deal to Bartók's quartets (; ), György Ligeti, whose two string quartets both owe a great deal to Bartók’s quartets (; ), Bruno Maderna , George Perle, who credits the Bartók Fourth and Fifth Quartets as precedents for his use of arrays of chords related to one another by different types of symmetry , Walter Piston (; ), Kim Dzmitrïyevich Tsesakow , Wilfried Westerlinck , Stefan Wolpe, who explained in a public lecture how he had derived ideas from Bartók’s Fourth Quartet , and Xu Yongsan .\n\npassage title: String Quartet No. 6 (Bartók)\nThe String Quartet No. 6, Sz.  114, BB 119, was the final string quartet that Béla Bartók wrote before his death.  It was begun in August 1939 in Saanen, Switzerland, where Bartók was a guest of his patron, the conductor Paul Sacher.  Shortly after he completed the Divertimento for String Orchestra on the 17th, he started on a commission for his friend, the violinist Zoltán Székely.  Székely was acting as intermediary for the \"New Hungarian Quartet\", who had given the Budapest premiere of the String Quartet No. 5.  With the outbreak of World War II and his mother's illness, Bartók returned to Budapest, where the quartet was finished in November.  After his mother's death, Bartók decided to leave with his family for the United States.  Due to the difficulties of the war, communication between Bartók and Székely was difficult, and the quartet was not premiered until 20 January 1941, when the Kolisch Quartet, to whom the work is dedicated, gave its premiere at the Town Hall in New York City.\n\npassage title: Palace of Music (Miskolc)\nThe Palace of Music (\"Zenepalota\") is a building in Bartók square, Miskolc, Hungary.  It is the building of the Béla Bartók Secondary School and the Béla Bartók Music Institute (a faculty of the University of Miskolc.)  The Palace was designed by Gyula Waelder in Neo-baroque style and was built between 1926 and 1927.  The construction was financed from USA loans, just like that of the Hotel Palace in Lillafüred and the Market Hall on Búza tér.\n\npassage title: The Barbarian (song)\n\"The Barbarian\" is the opening track on the eponymous debut album of British progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer, released in 1970.  The song is instrumental, and it is the shortest song on the album (4:27).  Although the composition of \"The Barbarian\" was attributed to the three band members, it is an arrangement for rock band of Béla Bartók’s 1911 piano piece \"Allegro barbaro\".  Although the original piece is for piano only, the band arranged the song for organ, bass, and drums too.  The music of the song is aggressive with a hard rock influence.  Greg Lake used a fuzz box to give his bass a fuller, guitar-like sound.  The band members didn't give credit to Bartók, thinking that the label would arrange the matter.  Bartók's family sued ELP for copyright infringement, but eventually, the band gave the credit to Bartók too.  The song was never included in a compilation album of the band until the album \"The Essential Emerson, Lake & Palmer\".\n\npassage title: Zorian Quartet\nThe Zorian Quartet was an English all-female string quartet ensemble.  It was founded in 1942 by and named after violinist Olive Zorian.  It gave the premiere performances of, and made the first recordings of, several compositions for string quartet by English composers, including Benjamin Britten and Michael Tippett.

A few species extend to temperate regions, with ca. 10 species in the United States, mostly in the southern states from California to Florida, and only two species in Canada; China has 35 species, also mostly southern.  Only one species (\"E. aquaticum\") occurs in Europe, where it is confined to the Atlantic Ocean coasts of Scotland and Ireland; this species also occurs in eastern North America and is thought to be a relatively recent natural colonist in Europe.  In the Americas, \"Eriocaulon\" is the only genus in its family that occurs north of Florida.  They tend to be associated with wet soils, many growing in shallow water, in wetlands, or in wet savannas like flatwoods.  In wet soils, their abundance appears to be related to water levels, fire frequency, and competition from other plants such as grasses.  Experiments have shown that they are weak competitors compared to many other wetland plant species.  Some species can persist as buried seeds during unfavorable conditions.

Part of the tribe segregated with the Eucharideae and were submerged into it, while the other part formed a unique subclade.  Since the type species of \"Stenomesson\" was not part of the second sublclade it was necessary to form a new name for the remaining species together with the other genera that remained.  This was \"Clinanthus\", the oldest name for these species, and consequently the tribe Clinantheae.\n\npassage title: Amarylloidinae\nAmarylloidinae is a now obsolete informal name for an \"infrafamily\" within the Amaryllidaceae (Amaryllis) family, erected by Hamilton Traub.  This grouping was designed to fill a perceived gap between the formal rank of subfamily and tribes.  In his treatment of this family, he divided it first into four subfamiles.  Within subfamily Amarylloideae he then divided his sixteen tribes into two infrafamilies, Amarylloidinae (12 tribes) and Pancratioidinae (4 tribes), both of which were subsequently demonstrated to be polyphyletic, and hence were abandoned by Dahlgren, who used no rank between family and tribe.  On the other hand, he also used a much more restricted Amaryllidaceae corresponding to Traub's subfamily Amarylloideae.  Thus Traub's Amarylloideae most closely resembles subfamily Amaryllidoideae \"sensu\" APGIII.\n\npassage title: Ammocharis\nAmmocharis is a small genus from sub-Saharan Africa, in the Amaryllidaceae family (subfamily Amaryllidoideae) which includes 7 species distributed in Africa.

The name is derived from the Greek words ἰατρός (\"iatros\"), meaning \"physician\", and τροφή (\"trophe\"), meaning \"nutrition\", hence the common name physic nut.  Another common name is nettlespurge.  It contains approximately 170 species of succulent plants, shrubs and trees (some are deciduous, like \"Jatropha curcas\").  Most of these are native to the Americas, with 66 species found in the Old World.  Plants produce separate male and female flowers.  As with many members of the family Euphorbiaceae, \"Jatropha\" contains compounds that are highly toxic.  Jatropha species have traditionally been used in basketmaking, tanning and dye production.  In the 2000s, one species, \"Jatropha curcas\", generated interest as an oil crop for biodiesel production.\n\npassage title: Nerine masoniorum\nNerine masoniorum is a species of flowering plant in the family Amaryllidaceae, subfamily Amaryllidoideae, native to the eastern Cape Province of South Africa.  It is a bulbous perennial.  \"N. masoniorum\" belongs to the group of nerines that have narrow evergreen foliage.  The thread-like leaves reach a length of 25 cm or more.  The flowering stem is 15–25 cm tall, with up to 11 flowers arranged in an umbel.  Each flower has six narrow pink tepals with wavy edges.

There are about 30 species included in the genus.  They are found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.\n\npassage title: Sex determination in Silene\n\"Silene\" are a flowering plant that evolved a dioecious reproductive system.  This is made possible through heteromorphic sex chromosomes expressed as XY.  \"Silene\" recently evolved sex chromosomes 5-10 million years ago and are widely used by geneticists and biologists to study the mechanisms of sex determination since they are one of only 39 species across 14 families of angiosperm that possess sex-determining genes.  \"Silene\" are studied because of their ability to produce offspring with a plethora of reproductive systems.  The common inference drawn from such studies is that the sex of the offspring is determined by the Y chromosome.\n\npassage title: Silene stenophylla\nSilene stenophylla is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae.

It can be found in many types of habitat and it is quite common in much of its range.  It is variable in morphology and there are a number of varied subtaxa.  In general, it is a perennial herb growing from a caudex, appearing matlike, decumbent, or erect, with stems a few centimeters to over half a meter long.  It is usually hairy in texture, with upper parts bearing sticky glandular hairs.  The leaves are lance-shaped, oppositely arranged in pairs, and a few centimeters in length, upper leaves usually smaller than lower.  Flowers may occur in a cyme at the top of the stem, or in leaf axils, or both.  Each is encapsulated in a hairy, veined calyx of fused sepals.  The petals are white with two lobes at the tips.  The plant is dioecious with male and female plants producing different flowers.  The male and female flower types look the same externally; the stamens are reduced in female plants and the stigmas are reduced in the male.\n\npassage title: Jatropha\nJatropha is a genus of flowering plants in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae.

Many members are succulent, having fleshy stems or leaves.\n\npassage title: Eriogonum heracleoides\nEriogonum heracleoides (common names parsnipflower buckwheat, whorled buckwheat, and Wyeth buckwheat) has many flowering clusters that are cream or off-white in color.  Its usual habitat is rocky areas such as sagebrush deserts and Ponderosa pine forests.  Parsnipflower buckwheat is in the genus \"Eriogonum\" and the family Polygonaceae which is a family of plants known as the \"knotweed family\".

This plant was first discovered in the Guano Valley in Lake County, Oregon, in 1978 by Bureau of Land Management botanist Virginia Crosby, and it was named for her in 1981.\n\npassage title: Silene\nSilene is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae.  Containing approximately 700 species, it is the largest genus in the family.  Common names include campion (which is shared with the related genus \"Lychnis\") and catchfly.  Many \"Silene\" species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere.\n\npassage title: Jatropha\nJatropha is a genus of flowering plants in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae.  The name is derived from the Greek words ἰατρός (\"iatros\"), meaning \"physician\", and τροφή (\"trophe\"), meaning \"nutrition\", hence the common name physic nut.  Another common name is nettlespurge.  It contains approximately 170 species of succulent plants, shrubs and trees (some are deciduous, like \"Jatropha curcas\").  Most of these are native to the Americas, with 66 species found in the Old World.  Plants produce separate male and female flowers.  As with many members of the family Euphorbiaceae, \"Jatropha\" contains compounds that are highly toxic.  Jatropha species have traditionally been used in basketmaking, tanning and dye production.

The genus is widely distributed, with the centers of diversity for the group occurring in tropical regions, particularly southern Asia and the Americas.  A few species extend to temperate regions, with ca. 10 species in the United States, mostly in the southern states from California to Florida, and only two species in Canada; China has 35 species, also mostly southern.  Only one species (\"E. aquaticum\") occurs in Europe, where it is confined to the Atlantic Ocean coasts of Scotland and Ireland; this species also occurs in eastern North America and is thought to be a relatively recent natural colonist in Europe.  In the Americas, \"Eriocaulon\" is the only genus in its family that occurs north of Florida.  They tend to be associated with wet soils, many growing in shallow water, in wetlands, or in wet savannas like flatwoods.  In wet soils, their abundance appears to be related to water levels, fire frequency, and competition from other plants such as grasses.  Experiments have shown that they are weak competitors compared to many other wetland plant species.  Some species can persist as buried seeds during unfavorable conditions.

References for information given in the list appear on the Wikipedia pages concerned.  This is a subsidiary list to the List of Colombian people.  The list is far from exhaustive, so please help to expand it by adding Wikipedia page-owning published writers who have written in any genre or field, including science and scholarship, but does not include those whose sole body of work lies outside conventional published literature such as: print journalists, bloggers, editors, librettists, lyricists, songwriters, playwrights, or screenwriters.  Please follow the entry format: use Spanish naming customs by listing both surnames of the person, use \"italics\" for authors who are best known under a pseudonym, indicate only the year of birth or the years of birth and death, and do not include place of birth or works associated with the writer, as that information should be found in their actual page.\n\npassage title: Canadian classical music\nIn Canada, classical music includes a range of musical styles rooted in the traditions of Western or European classical music that European settlers brought to the country from the 17th century and onwards.  As well, it includes musical styles brought by other ethnic communities from the 19th century and onwards, such as Indian classical music (Hindustani and Carnatic music) and Chinese classical music.  Since Canada's emergence as a nation in 1867, the country has produced its own composers, musicians and ensembles.  As well, it has developed a music infrastructure that includes training institutions, conservatories, performance halls, and a public radio broadcaster, CBC, which programs a moderate amount of Classical music.  There is a high level of public interest in classical music and education.\n\npassage title: Musical composition\nMusical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music.  People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.\n\npassage title: Dan Johnson (musician)\nDan Johnson is an American drummer for Korn guitarist Brian Welch and Love and Death, is the touring percussionist for Red and was the drummer for rock metal band Back from Ashes and hard rock band The Sammus Theory.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Are Even and Incubus known for their skill in classical music?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"Incubus is an American rock band, and Even is not mentioned in the given doc.

The charts are commercial monitoring and marketing devices used by the UK music industry to measure its effectiveness in promoting and selling albums, nominally in the field of classical music.  All three charts are compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC).  The measurements are made by collating the returns of sales from a number of well-known music stores (high street and online stores) on a regular basis, and this enables a ranking to be established.  Most classical artist album sales in the UK are from crossover artists.  For an album to be classified as classical in the charts, it has to have 60% of the playing time dedicated to \"classical or traditional music\".  Only albums that entirely classical or traditional music qualify for inclusion in the Specialist Classical Albums Chart.\n\npassage title: Ted Kooshian\nTed Kooshian (born October 8, 1961) is an American jazz pianist, keyboardist, and composer, who has performed with Aretha Franklin, Chuck Berry, Marvin Hamlisch, Sarah Brightman, Il Divo, and Blood, Sweat, and Tears.

She became famous as a candidate for the 1958 São Paulo city council elections with the intention of protesting against political corruption.  Electoral officials did not accept Cacareco's candidacy, but she eventually won 100,000 votes, more than any other party in that same election (which was also marked by rampant absenteeism).  Today, the term \"voto Cacareco\" (Cacareco vote) is commonly used to describe protest votes in Brazil.  Cacareco's candidacy inspired the Rhinoceros Party of Canada, nominally led by the rhinoceros Cornelius the First.\n\npassage title: Rhinoceros Party of Canada (1963–93)\nThe Rhinoceros Party (French: \"Parti Rhinocéros\") was a registered political party in Canada from the 1960s to the 1990s.  Operating within the tradition of political satire, the Rhinoceros Party's basic credo, their so-called primal promise, was \"a promise to keep none of our promises\".  They then promised outlandishly impossible schemes designed to amuse and entertain the voting public.\n\npassage title: Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada\nThe Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada, or RCP Canada, is a revolutionary communist party oriented around Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.  The creation of the organizational stage of the Party was adopted at what was called the \"Revolutionary Communist Conference\", which was held in Montreal, Quebec in November 2000 by activists and former members of the labour union movements and youth organizations of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, who felt that the revolutionary situation in Canada warranted the creation of a Party dedicated to a communist revolution.  The party was initially called the Revolutionary Communist Party (Organizing Committees) (RCP(OC)).  At this conference, participants adopted the Party's first Draft Programme.  Because of the location of the conference, the majority of the founding members were French-speaking Quebecers, and the Party began an extensive effort to reach out to the rest of Canada, starting with the Canadian Revolutionary Congress held in November 2006 in Toronto.  It is not recognized as a political party by Elections Canada, because the party rejects what it calls the \"bourgeois electoral system\" and doesn't seek recognition by the State.\n\npassage title: The New Canada\nThe New Canada is a Canadian political literature book written by Reform Party of Canada founder and leader Preston Manning and published by Macmillan Canada.  The book explains the personal, religious, and political life of Preston Manning and explains the roots and beliefs of the Reform Party.  At the time of its publishing in 1992, Reform had become a popular populist conservative party in Western Canada after the mainstream Progressive Conservative Party of Canada was collapsing in support and in 1991 decided to expand eastward into Ontario and the Maritimes.  One year later the PC party collapsed in the 1993 federal election, allowing the Reform Party to make political history in Canada, deplacing the PCs as the dominant conservative party in Canada.  Reform, later renamed the Canadian Alliance, merged with the PC Party in 2003, to form a united right-wing alternative to the governing Liberal Party of Canada, named the Conservative Party of Canada which has dropped many of the populist themes that the Reform Party had.\n\npassage title: Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada\nThe Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada (APP) is a Canadian political party that was founded in 2005.  The party was conceived by University of Lethbridge student Myron Wolf Child.  It held its founding meeting on August 21, 2005, in St. Albert, Alberta.  The APP was headed by interim leader Bill Montour, a former Chief of the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario.  In October 2005, the party had 122 confirmed members, just less than half the number needed to register as an official party in Canada.  In late October 2005, the APP sought to unite with the First Peoples National Party of Canada which also had fewer than the number of confirmed members needed to become a registered political party.  The First Peoples National Party of Canada became an eligible political party on December 6, 2005.  Whether or not this was accomplished through a merger with the APP is unclear.  If this is the case, the APP no longer exists, but, as one of the stipulations of a possible merger was that a name for the new party would be determined at the party's first convention, it is possible that the name Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada will come into usage again.\n\npassage title: National Advancement Party of Canada\nThe National Advancement Party of Canada (French: \"Parti de l'Essor National du Canada\" ) is a minor federal political party in Canada.  The party describes itself as for \"advancement of the Canadian people and Canada\".

He founded and led the Brazilian Integralist Action, a far-right political party inspired on the Italian Fascist movement.\n\npassage title: Black Dossier (film)\nBlack Dossier (French: \"Le Dossier noir\" ) is a 1955 French drama film directed by André Cayatte.  It was entered into the 1955 Cannes Film Festival.\n\npassage title: Pagode (music)\nPagode is a type of Brazilian country-folk traditional style of music.  It's also known as Cipó Preto (black liana), Pagode caipira (rural pagode) or Pagode sertanejo (folk pagode).  Sertanejo means anything that comes from the back-country, outback or simply the countryside.  This style of music was pioneered by musicians Tião Carreiro and Lourival dos Santos in the late 1950s, when they fused the \"Coco\" and \"Calango de roda\" rhythms.  Although other instruments can be added, it is much characterized by its simple, acoustic approach, with the use of just one or two viola guitars, often accompanied by an acoustic guitar and, at times, a light percussion section.  A structural feature commonly used in this genre is the alternation of verses sung with the accompaniement of a classical guitar, with solos of viola caipira.  Pieces can be entirely instrumental or have one or two singers, usually: when there are two lead vocals (that can be men, women or a combination), they sing together on a steady interval.  The metrics used are usually of five or seven-syllable roundels, and in presentations, songs quite often are linked together, on a medley.  Another notable feature are its lyrics, that tend to portray the everyday life of country people, telling stories about simple life, nature, love, booze, animals and so on.\n</doc>\n<Question>: When did the party inspired by Cacareco begin in Canada?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"Cacareco, a female black rhinoceros, became famous as a candidate for the 1958 São Paulo city council elections.

It was released in May 1983 as the second single from Williams' album \"Strong Stuff\".  The song reached number 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart.  It was written by Williams, Dean Dillon, Gary Stewart and Tanya Tucker.  The song is notable for its combination of two singers associated with the outlaw movement with a country legend from the honky tonk days and golden age of the Grand Ole Opry.  Outlaw singers like Williams and Jennings saw themselves as taking country music back to its raw, honky tonk roots, and recording an up tempo song with Tubb (who would never have received radio airplay in the late 1970s and early 80's) and reaching #6 was a slap in the face to the proponents of the country pop sound.  The lyrics of the song, much like Williams' \"Family Tradition\" echo the sentiment that the outlaw singers and their current escapades were predated by the hard living honky tonkers of the 1950s such as Hank Williams, Sr. and Ernest Tubb, prior to the music being fairly taken over by the Nashville Sound in the 1960s.\n\npassage title: Waltzing Matilda\n\"Waltzing Matilda\" is Australia's best-known bush ballad, and has been described as the country's \"unofficial national anthem\".\n\npassage title: Little Eyes\nLittle Eyes or Little Lize (Lil' Lize) is a folksong that is popular in Cornwall, England, UK, although it originated in America.

An estimated 2,500 mature individuals survived worldwide as of 1996, according to the IUCN, although it is uncertain of how many of them still survive in the wild.  The diet of the deer, which consists of a variety of different types of grasses, leaves, and buds within the forest, is the primary indicator of its habitat.

Moose typically inhabit boreal forests and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates. Hunting and other human activities have caused a reduction in the size of the moose's range over time.  Moose have been reintroduced to some of their former habitats.  Currently, most moose are found in Canada, Alaska, New England, Fennoscandia, Baltic States, and Russia.  Their diet consists of both terrestrial and aquatic vegetation.  The most common moose predators are the gray wolf along with bears and humans. Unlike most other deer species, moose are solitary animals and do not form herds.

It was written by Williams, Dean Dillon, Gary Stewart and Tanya Tucker.  The song is notable for its combination of two singers associated with the outlaw movement with a country legend from the honky tonk days and golden age of the Grand Ole Opry.  Outlaw singers like Williams and Jennings saw themselves as taking country music back to its raw, honky tonk roots, and recording an up tempo song with Tubb (who would never have received radio airplay in the late 1970s and early 80's) and reaching #6 was a slap in the face to the proponents of the country pop sound.  The lyrics of the song, much like Williams' \"Family Tradition\" echo the sentiment that the outlaw singers and their current escapades were predated by the hard living honky tonkers of the 1950s such as Hank Williams, Sr. and Ernest Tubb, prior to the music being fairly taken over by the Nashville Sound in the 1960s.\n</doc>\n<Question>: What two singers who worked together on the song I Would Like to See You Again also performed as part of a country music group which was active between 1985 and 1995?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"The song 'I Would Like to See You Again' features a duet between Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings.

Brag is a direct descendant of the Elizabethan game of Primero and one of the several ancestors to poker, just varying in betting style and hand rankings.\n\npassage title: Gleek (card game)\nGleek is an English card game for three persons.  It is played with a 44-card pack and was popular from the 16th century through the 18th century.\n\npassage title: Egyptian Ratscrew\nEgyptian Ratscrew (also known as Egyptian Ratkiller, Egyptian War, and by other names) is a card game of the matching family of games.  The game is similar to the 19th century British card game Beggar-My-Neighbour, with the added concept of \"slapping\" cards when certain combinations are played, similar to and perhaps borrowed from Slapjack.\n\npassage title: Écarté\nÉcarté is a two-player card game originating from France, the word literally meaning \"discarded\".  It is a trick-taking game, similar to whist, but with a special and eponymous discarding phase.  It is closely related to Euchre, a card game played mainly in the United States.  Écarté was popular in the 19th century, but is now rarely played.\n\npassage title: Triomphe\nTriomphe (French for triumph) is a card game dating from the late 15th century.  It most likely originated in France or Spain (as triunfo) and later spread to the rest of Europe.  When the game arrived in Italy, it shared a similar name with the pre-existing game and deck known as \"trionfi\" (tarot).  While trionfi has a fifth suit that acts as permanent trumps, triomphe randomly selects one of the existing four suits as trumps.  Another common feature of this game is the robbing of the stock.  Triomphe became so popular that during the 16th century the earlier game of trionfi was gradually renamed tarocchi, tarot, or tarock.  This game is the origin of the English word \"trump\" and is the ancestor of many trick-taking games like Euchre (via Écarté) and Whist (via Ruff and Honours).\n\npassage title: Quadrille (card game)\nQuadrille is a card game that was popular in the 18th century.

Hatherley and first published in 1980.  It is similar to \"Monopoly\" but the board is divided into companies rather than properties.  Players compete to acquire properties and investments through stylized economic and political activity.  The playing time is set by agreement from all players, e.g. 2 hours, and the winner is determined by the monetary sum of all player cash, companies, insurance or other assets.  The game can also end when there are no more companies, advertisements in the bank or bonds in the treasury.  Another objective of the game is \"to teach players some of the fundamentals of economics, and the ways in which the economy and the government interact.\"  Different editions were published for several different countries.  The name \"Poleconomy\" is a portmanteau of \"politics\" and \"economy\".\n\npassage title: Put (card game)\nPut is an English tavern trick-taking card game first recorded in the 16th century and later castigated by 17th century moralists as one of ill repute.  It belongs to a very ancient family of card games and clearly relates to a group known as Trut, \"Truque\", also \"Tru\", and the South American game Truco.  Its more elaborate version is the Spanish game of Truc, which is still much played in many parts of Southern France and Spain.\n\npassage title: Ombre\nThe historical importance of Ombre in the field of playing cards is the fact that it was the first card game in which a trump suit was established by bidding rather than by the random process of turning the first card of the stock.  This game developed from Triunfo, though it was from L'Hombre that the idea of bidding was adopted into other card games such as Skat, and Tarot, which owes Hombre a good portion of its betting system as well.  The game continued to be in vogue almost in every corner of Europe from the late 17th through the 18th centuries.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Crash is similar to what 16th century British card game in the sense that there is no betting?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"Crash is a British card game extension of Nine-card Brag.

He is most well known for providing the singing voice of Tony (played onscreen by Richard Beymer) in the 1961 film musical \"West Side Story\".  While he received no screen credit, he states that Beymer was \"a nice guy, and every time he did an interview he would mention my name.\"  He also sang for James Fox in the 1967 film musical \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\", and sang in \"The Telephone Hour\" number in \"Bye Bye Birdie\".  He also sang in the group that performed the theme song of the TV series \"Batman\".\n\npassage title: West Side Story (film)\nWest Side Story is a 1961 American musical romantic drama film directed by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins.  The film is an adaptation of the 1957 Broadway musical of the same name, which in turn was inspired by William Shakespeare's play \"Romeo and Juliet\".  It stars Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno, and George Chakiris, and was photographed by Daniel L. Fapp, A.S.C., in Super Panavision 70.  Released on October 18, 1961 through United Artists, the film received high praise from critics and viewers, and became the second highest grossing film of the year in the United States.  The film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won 10, including Best Picture (as well as a special award for Robbins), becoming the record holder for the most wins for a movie musical.\n\npassage title: Academy Honorary Award\nThe Academy Honorary Award – instituted in 1948 for the 21st Academy Awards (previously called the Special Award, which was first presented in early 1929) – is given annually by the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) to celebrate motion picture achievements that are not covered by existing Academy Awards, although prior winners of competitive Academy Awards are not excluded from receiving the Honorary Award.  Unless otherwise specified, Honorary Award recipients receive the same gold Oscar statuettes received by winners of the competitive Academy Awards.  Unlike the Special Achievement Award instituted in 1972 (and discontinued in 1995), those on whom the Academy confers its Honorary Award do not have to meet \"the Academy's eligibility year and deadline requirements.\"  Like the Special Achievement Award, the Special Award and Honorary Award have been used to reward significant achievements of the year that did not fit in existing categories, subsequently leading the Academy to establish several new categories, and to honor exceptional career achievements, contributions to the motion picture industry, and service to the Academy.  The Academy Honorary Award is often awarded in preference to those with noted achievements in motion pictures who have nevertheless never won an Academy Award.  Thus, many of its recipients are Classic Hollywood stars, such as Lillian Gish, Barbara Stanwyck, Kirk Douglas, and Lauren Bacall.\n\npassage title: Grammy Award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance\nThe Grammy Award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance was an honor presented to male recording artists at the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003 and the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004 for quality rap solo performances.  The Grammy Awards, an annual ceremony that was established in 1958, and originally called the Gramophone Awards, are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".\n\npassage title: Triple Crown of Acting\nThe Triple Crown of Acting is a term used in the American entertainment industry to describe actors who have won a competitive Academy Award, Emmy Award, and Tony Award in the acting categories.  23 people have achieved the triple crown of acting (14 women, 9 men).  Helen Hayes' Emmy Award win on February 5, 1953, made her the first person to achieve the triple crown.  Thomas Mitchell became the first man to achieve the triple crown with his Tony Award win later the same year on March 29, 1953.  Hayes and Rita Moreno are the only triple crown winners in competitive acting categories who have also won a Grammy Award to complete the EGOT.\n\npassage title: Soap Opera Digest Award for Hottest Male Star\nThe Soap Opera Digest Award for Hottest Male Star has been given every year since the ninth Soap Opera Digest Award in 1993 until 1999.\n\npassage title: Academy Award for Best Film Editing\nThe Academy Award for Best Film Editing is one of the annual awards of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS).  Nominations for this award are closely correlated with the Academy Award for Best Picture.  For 33 consecutive years, 1981 to 2013, every Best Picture winner had also been nominated for the Film Editing Oscar, and about two thirds of the Best Picture winners have also won for Film Editing.  Only the principal, \"above the line\" editor(s) as listed in the film's credits are named on the award; additional editors, supervising editors, etc. are not currently eligible.  The nominations for this Academy Award are determined by a ballot of the voting members of the Editing Branch of the Academy; there were 220 members of the Editing Branch in 2012.  The members may vote for up to five of the eligible films in the order of their preference; the five films with the largest vote totals are selected as nominees.  The Academy Award itself is selected from the nominated films by a subsequent ballot of all active and life members of the Academy.  This process is essentially the reverse of that of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA); nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Editing are done by a general ballot of Academy voters, and the winner is selected by members of the editing chapter.\n\npassage title: Ten Guitars\n\"Ten Guitars\" is a 1967 song by the English singer Engelbert Humperdinck.  It was the B-side to his single \"Release Me\".  The song is especially well known in New Zealand, where it has become a beloved folk song and is considered by some to be the \"unofficial national anthem\" of New Zealand.\n\npassage title: Cate Blanchett\nCatherine Elise Blanchett, {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} ( ; born 14 May 1969) is an Australian actress and theatre director.  She has received international acclaim and many accolades, including two Academy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, three BAFTA Awards, six AACTA Awards, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards. Blanchett came to international attention for her role as Elizabeth I of England in Shekhar Kapur's 1998 film \"Elizabeth\", for which she won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress, the Golden Globe Award, and earned her first Academy Award for Best Actress nomination.  Her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn in Martin Scorsese's 2004 film \"The Aviator\" brought her critical acclaim and many accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, making her the only actor to win an Oscar for portraying another Oscar-winning actor.  In 2013, she starred as Jasmine Francis in Woody Allen's \"Blue Jasmine\", for which she won numerous accolades including the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\npassage title: Geoffrey Rush\nGeoffrey Roy Rush {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} (born 6 July 1951) is an Australian actor and film producer.  Rush is the youngest amongst the few people who have won the \"Triple Crown of Acting\": the Academy Award, the Primetime Emmy Award, and the Tony Award.  He has won one Academy Award for acting (from four nominations), three British Academy Film Awards (from five nominations), two Golden Globe Awards and four Screen Actors Guild Awards. Rush is the founding President of the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts and was named the 2012 Australian of the Year.  He is also the first actor to win the Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Critics' Choice Movie Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award for a single performance in film for his performance in \"Shine\" (1996).\n</doc>\n<Question>: How many Academy Awards did the film, in which Jimmy Bryant provided the singing voice for the character Tony, win ?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"West Side Story is a 1961 American musical romantic drama film directed by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins.

In 2007 he was listed by \"The Times Higher Education Guide\" as the sixth most-cited author in the humanities and social sciences, behind Anthony Giddens, Pierre Bourdieu and Michel Foucault, and ahead of Jürgen Habermas.\n\npassage title: Goffman (disambiguation)\nErving Goffman (1922–1982) was a Canadian sociologist\n\npassage title: Roger Ebert\nRoger Joseph Ebert ( ; June 18, 1942 – April 4, 2013) was an American film critic and historian, journalist, screenwriter, and author.  He was a film critic for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" from 1967 until his death in 2013.  In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism.\n\npassage title: Michel Foucault\nPaul-Michel Foucault (15 October 1926 – 25 June 1984), generally known as Michel Foucault (] ), was a French philosopher, historian of ideas, social theorist, and literary critic.\n\npassage title: Dramaturgy (sociology)\nDramaturgy is a sociological perspective commonly used in microsociological accounts of social interaction in everyday life.  The term was first adapted into sociology from the theatre by Erving Goffman, who developed most of the related terminology and ideas in his 1959 book, \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\".  Kenneth Burke, whom Goffman would later acknowledge as an influence, had earlier presented his notions of dramatism in 1945, which in turn derives from Shakespeare.  However, the fundamental difference between Burke's and Goffman's view is that Burke believed that life was in fact theatre, whereas Goffman viewed theatre as a metaphor.  If we imagine ourselves as directors observing what goes on in the theatre of everyday life, we are doing what Goffman called dramaturgical analysis, the study of social interaction in terms of theatrical performance.\n\npassage title: Ebertfest: Roger Ebert's Film Festival\nRoger Ebert's Film Festival, originally known as Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival but commonly referred to as simply Ebertfest, is an annual film festival held every April in Champaign, Illinois, United States, organized by the College of Media at the University of Illinois.  Roger Ebert, the TV and \"Chicago Sun-Times\" film critic, was a native of the adjoining town of Urbana, Illinois and is an alumnus of the University.  Founded in 1999, this event is the only long-running film festival created by a critic.  Despite Ebert’s death in 2013, the festival continues to operate based on Ebert’s notes and vision for the kinds of films he championed.\n\npassage title: The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\nThe Presentation of Self in Everyday Life is a 1956 sociology book by Erving Goffman, in which Goffman uses the imagery of the theatre in order to portray the importance of human social interaction.  Originally published in Scotland in 1956 and in the United States in 1959, it is Goffman’s first and most famous book, for which he received the American Sociological Association’s MacIver award in 1961.\n\npassage title: Ebert Presents: At the Movies\nEbert Presents: At the Movies was a weekly, nationally syndicated movie review television program produced and presented by film critic Roger Ebert and co-produced by his wife, Chaz Ebert.  The program aired on public television stations in the United States through American Public Television.\n\npassage title: Identity Performance\nIn everyday interactions, the body serves as a critical site of identity performance.  In conveying who we are to other people, we use our bodies to project information about ourselves.  This is done through movement, clothes, speech, and facial expressions.  What we put forward is our best effort at what we want to say about who we are.  Yet while we intend to convey one impression, our performance is not always interpreted as we might expect.  Through learning to make sense of others’ responses to our behavior, we can assess how well we have conveyed what we intended.  We can then alter our performance accordingly.  This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment is what Erving Goffman calls impression management.  Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation through their behavior.  People seek to define social situations by using contextual cues from the environment around them.  Social norms emerge from situational definitions, as people learn to read cues from the environment and the people present to understand what is appropriate behavior.\n\npassage title: Total institution\nA total institution is a place of work and residence where a great number of similarly situated people, cut off from the wider community for a considerable time, together lead an enclosed, formally administered round of life.  The concept is mostly associated with the work of sociologist Erving Goffman.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Erving Goffman was cited as higher than a literary critic on which guide?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"Erving Goffman was listed by 'The Times Higher Education Guide' as the sixth most-cited author in the humanities and social sciences, behind Anthony Giddens, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel Foucault, and ahead of Jürgen Habermas.

However, Canada has evolved variations: party discipline in Canada is stronger than in the United Kingdom and more parliamentary votes are considered motions of confidence, which tends to diminish the role of non-Cabinet Members of Parliament, (MPs).  Such members, in the government caucus, and junior or lower-profile members of opposition caucuses, are known as backbenchers. Backbenchers can, however, exert their influence by sitting in parliamentary committees, like the Public Accounts Committee or the National-Defence Committee.\n</doc>\n<Question>: What star if the Burbs was Canadian?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"The 'Burbs is a 1989 American comedy thriller film directed by Joe Dante starring Tom Hanks, Bruce Dern, Carrie Fisher, Rick Ducommun, Corey Feldman, Wendy Schaal and Henry Gibson.

Diduryk\nMyron F. Diduryk (July 15, 1938 to April 24, 1970) was a Ukrainian-American United States Army Major, who played a key role as an infantry company commander in the Battle of Ia Drang, the first major battle of the Vietnam War.  His exploits in that battle were described by Hal Moore in, \"We Were Soldiers Once and Young\".  Moore said that Diduryk was, “… the finest battlefield company commander I had ever seen, bar none.”  Diduryk was killed in action on his second tour in Vietnam.\n\npassage title: Hal Moore\nHarold Gregory \"Hal\" Moore, Jr. (February 13, 1922 – February 10, 2017) was a United States Army lieutenant general and author.  He was a recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross, which is the U.S. military's second highest decoration for valor, and was the first of his West Point class (1945) to be promoted to brigadier general, major general, and lieutenant general.\n\npassage title: Major general (United States)\nIn the United States Army, United States Marine Corps, and United States Air Force, major general is a two-star general-officer rank, with the pay grade of O-8.  Major general ranks above brigadier general and below lieutenant general.  A major general typically commands division-sized units of 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers.  Major general is equivalent to the two-star rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard and is the highest permanent rank during peacetime in the uniformed services.  (The higher ranks are temporary ranks linked to specific positions, although virtually all officers who have been promoted to those ranks are approved to retire at their highest earned rank.)\n\npassage title: Benedict Arnold\nBenedict Arnold (January 14, 1741 [O.S. January 3, 1740] June 14, 1801) was a general during the American Revolutionary War, who fought for the American Continental Army, and later defected to the British Army.  While a general on the American side, he obtained command of the fortifications at West Point, New York (which after 1802 would become the site of the U.S. Military Academy), overlooking the cliffs at the Hudson River (upriver from British-occupied New York City), and planned to surrender them to British forces.  This plan was exposed in September 1780.  He was commissioned into the British Army as a brigadier general.\n\npassage title: Generalissimus of the Soviet Union\nGeneralissimo of the Soviet Union (Russian: Генералиссимус Советского Союза ; \"Generalissimus Sovétskogo Soyuza\") was a proposed military rank created on 27 June 1945, following the tradition of the Imperial Russian Army.  It was granted to Joseph Stalin following World War II; however, Stalin refused to officially approve the rank.  It would have been the highest military rank in the Soviet Union.\n\npassage title: Podporucznik\nPodporucznik (literally \"sub-porucznik\") is a military rank of the Polish Army, roughly equivalent to the military rank of the Second Lieutenant in the armed forces of the English-speaking countries.  The rank of \"Podporucznik\" is awarded by the office of the President of Poland to graduates of the Tadeusz Kościuszko Land Forces Military Academy in Wrocław.\n\npassage title: Richard E. Cavazos\nRichard Edward Cavazos (born January 31, 1929), a Korean War recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross as a first lieutenant, who advanced in rank to become the United States Army's first Hispanic four-star general.  During the Vietnam War, as a lieutenant colonel, Cavazos was awarded a second Distinguished Service Cross.  In 1976, Cavazos became the first Mexican American to reach the rank of brigadier general in the U.S. Army.  Cavazos served with great distinction for thirty-three years, with his final command as head of the U.S. Army Forces Command.\n\npassage title: Distinguished Service Cross (United States)\nThe Distinguished Service Cross is the second highest military award that can be given to a member of the United States Army (and previously, the United States Army Air Forces and the United States Air Force), for extreme gallantry and risk of life in actual combat with an armed enemy force.  Actions that merit the Distinguished Service Cross must be of such a high degree that they are above those required for all other U.S. combat decorations but do not meet the criteria for the Medal of Honor.  The Distinguished Service Cross is equivalent to the Navy Cross (Navy and Marine Corps), the Air Force Cross (Air Force), and the Coast Guard Cross (Coast Guard).\n\npassage title: Corporal\nCorporal is a military rank in use in some form by many militaries and by some police forces or other uniformed organizations.  Within NATO, each member nation's corresponding military rank of corporal is combined under the NATO-standard rank scale code OR-4.  However, there are often differences in how each nation (or service in each nation) employs corporals.  Some militaries don't have corporals, but may instead have a Junior Sergeant.\n\npassage title: List of Generalobersts\nGeneraloberst, in English Colonel General, was, in Germany and Austria-Hungary—the German \"Reichswehr\" and \"Wehrmacht\", the Austro-Hungarian Common Army, and the East German National People's Army, as well as the respective police services—the second highest general officer rank, ranking above full general but below general field marshal.  It was equivalent to \"Generaladmiral\" in the \"Kriegsmarine\" until 1945, or to Flottenadmiral in the \"Volksmarine\" until 1990.  The rank was the highest ordinary military rank and the highest military rank awarded in peacetime; the higher rank of general field marshal was only awarded in wartime by the head of state.  In general, a Generaloberst had the same privileges as a general field marshal.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Myron F.

This made it the first Chinese-owned bank in Hong Kong.  At the time, all the other banks in Hong Kong were foreign, primarily British, including the locally incorporated but British-run Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.  Security Pacific National Bank (SPNB) bought a majority share in Bank of Canton in 1971.  In 1988, Security Pacific succeeded in wholly acquiriing Bank of Canton, which became Security Pacific Asia Bank.  When Bank of America acquired Security Pacific Corporation in 1993 it changed Security Pacific Asia Bank’s name to Bank of America (Asia).

There was a continuous issue till the Second World War in different colours and dimensions, and this issue was resumed after the war in 1946, by the HSBC, Mercantile and Standard Chartered Banks.  This was somewhat standardised in 1970 when the Chartered Bank changed the issue from brown to red, red was the colour of the other two issues.  The Mercantile bank stopped issuing banknotes after 1974 and the Bank of China issued their version in 1994.  The colour was made uniform when red for all banknotes was adopted.\n\npassage title: HSBC\nHSBC Holdings PLC is a British multinational banking and financial services holding company, tracing its origin to a hong in Hong Kong.  It is the world's seventh largest bank by total assets and the largest in Europe with total assets of US$2.374 trillion (as of December 2016).  It was established in its present form in London in 1991 by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited to act as a new group holding company.  The origins of the bank lie mainly in Hong Kong and to a lesser extent in Shanghai, where branches were first opened in 1865.  The HSBC name is derived from the initials of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.  The company was first formally incorporated in 1866.  The company continues to see both the United Kingdom and Hong Kong as its \"home markets\".\n\npassage title: Hong Kong fifty-dollar note\nThe fifty-dollar note was first issued undated in the 1860s by the Oriental Bank Corporation, the Mercantile Bank, the Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) but a confirmed date for this bank is 1879, followed by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1877.

This term comes from the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the British parliament.\n\npassage title: Politics of Canada\nThe politics of Canada function within a framework of parliamentary democracy and a federal system of parliamentary government with strong democratic traditions.  Canada is a constitutional monarchy, in which the Monarch is head of state.  The country has a multi-party system in which many of its legislative practices derive from the unwritten conventions of and precedents set by the United Kingdom's Westminster Parliament.  However, Canada has evolved variations: party discipline in Canada is stronger than in the United Kingdom and more parliamentary votes are considered motions of confidence, which tends to diminish the role of non-Cabinet Members of Parliament, (MPs).  Such members, in the government caucus, and junior or lower-profile members of opposition caucuses, are known as backbenchers. Backbenchers can, however, exert their influence by sitting in parliamentary committees, like the Public Accounts Committee or the National-Defence Committee.\n\npassage title: Governance of England\nThere has not been a government of England since 1707 when the Kingdom of England ceased to exist as a sovereign state, as it merged with the Kingdom of Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.  Kingdom of Great Britain continued from 1707 until 1801 when it merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which itself became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) in 1922 (in reality; in name in 1927) upon independence for most of the island of Ireland.  The UK since then has gone through significant change to its system of government, with devolved parliaments, assemblies and governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  England, however, remains under the full jurisdiction, on all matters, of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the UK government as no devolved administration has been created for England within the new structure.  This situation has led to the anomaly, known as the West Lothian question, which is that Scottish Members of Parliament (MPs) are able to vote on legislation that affects only England whereas English MPs can not vote on certain Scottish matters due to devolution.  In some cases, such as top-up university tuition fees and foundation hospitals, the votes of Scottish MPs have been crucial in helping pass legislation for England that the majority of English MPs have opposed.\n\npassage title: Canada under British rule\nCanada first came under British rule with the Treaty of Paris (1763) which ceded New France, of which Canada was a part, to the British Empire.  Gradually, other territories, colonies, and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada.  The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas.  With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada.  Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.  A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation.  Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949.  Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.  This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom, and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  Canada's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act, subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom.\n\npassage title: Quebec Legislature\nThe Quebec Legislature (officially Parliament of Quebec, French: \"Parlement du Québec\" ) is the legislature of the province of Quebec, Canada, since Confederation in 1867.  Today, the legislature is made of two elements: the monarch of Canada, represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, and the unicameral assembly called the National Assembly of Quebec.  The legislature has existed since 1867 when Quebec, then called Canada East, became one of the founding colonies of Canadian Confederation.  From 1867 until 1968 the legislature was bicameral, containing a lower chamber called the Legislative Assembly of Quebec and an upper chamber called the Legislative Council of Quebec.\n\npassage title: British North America Acts\nThe British North America Acts 1867–1975 are the original names of a series of Acts at the core of the constitution of Canada.  They were enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Parliament of Canada.  In Canada, some of the Acts were amended or repealed by the Constitution Act, 1982.  The rest were renamed in Canada as the \"Constitution Acts\".  In the United Kingdom, those Acts that were passed by the British Parliament remain under their original names.  The term \"British North America\" (BNA) refers to the British colonies in North America.\n\npassage title: Westminster\nWestminster ( ) is an area of central London within the City of Westminster, part of the West End, on the north bank of the River Thames.  Westminster's concentration of visitor attractions and historic landmarks, one of the highest in London, includes the Palace of Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and Westminster Cathedral.\n\npassage title: Australian Public Service\nThe Australian Public Service (APS) is the federal civil service of the Commonwealth of Australia responsible for the public administration, public policy, and public services of the departments and executive and statutory agencies of the Government of Australia.  The Australian Public Service was established at the Federation of Australia in 1901 as the Commonwealth Public Service and modeled on the Westminster system and United Kingdom's Civil Service.  The establishment and operation of the Australian Public Service is governed by the \"Public Service Act 1999\" of the Parliament of Australia as an \"apolitical public service that is efficient and effective in serving the Government, the Parliament and the Australian public\".  The conduct of Australian public servants is also governed by a Code of Conduct and guided by the APS Values set by the Australian Public Service Commission.\n\npassage title: Constitution of Alberta\nThe Constitution of Alberta describes the fundamental rules under which the Canadian province of Alberta is governed.  As is typical of all Canadian provinces, and Westminster systems more generally, Alberta's is an unwritten constitution.  Alberta's constitution, like Britain's (on which it is modeled), includes any and all pieces of legislation, court decisions, proclamations, and conventions which together inform how the province operates.  Many statutes are important to understanding the governance of the province, but nowhere are they consolidated into a single document or even a list.  The office of Attorney-General at one time suggested 23 acts which might be included, but cautioned that this was not a \"definitive list\".  However, since Alberta is a part of federation, its powers are clearly delineated in law, via the Constitution of Canada.\n\npassage title: Westminster tube station\nWestminster is a London Underground station in the City of Westminster.  It is served by the Circle, District and Jubilee lines.  On the Circle and District lines, the station is between St. James's Park and Embankment, and on the Jubilee line it is between Green Park and Waterloo.  It is in Travelcard Zone 1.  The station is located at the corner of Bridge Street and Victoria Embankment and is close to the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, Parliament Square, Whitehall, Westminster Bridge, and the London Eye.

The club is officially known as \"le Club de hockey Canadien \".  Founded in 1909, they have played a total of 107 seasons, 8 with the National Hockey Association (NHA) and 99 with the NHA's successor, the NHL.  They are the only club to have played every season for both leagues and the only active NHL team to pre-date the founding of that league.  They have won the Stanley Cup 24 times, once under the NHA and 23 times since the founding of the NHL, and have also won 11 O'Brien Cup titles, 24 division championships, and 8 conference championships.  Overall they have the most games played, most wins, most ties, most points, highest points percentage, most years in the playoffs, most division championships, and most Stanley Cup championships of any team in the NHL.\n\npassage title: History of the National Hockey League\nThe history of the National Hockey League begins with the end of its predecessor league, the National Hockey Association (NHA), in 1917.  After unsuccessfully attempting to resolve disputes with Eddie Livingstone, owner of the Toronto Blueshirts, executives of the three other NHA franchises suspended the NHA, and formed the National Hockey League (NHL), replacing the Livingstone team with a temporary team in Toronto, the Arenas.  The NHL's first quarter-century saw the league compete against two rival major leagues—the Pacific Coast Hockey Association and Western Canada Hockey League—for players and the Stanley Cup.  The NHL first expanded into the United States in 1924 with the founding of the Boston Bruins, and by 1926 consisted of ten teams in Ontario, Quebec, the Great Lakes region, and the Northeastern United States.  At the same time, the NHL emerged as the only major league and the sole competitor for the Stanley Cup; in 1947, the NHL completed a deal with the Stanley Cup trustees to gain full control of the Cup.  The NHL's footprint spread across Canada as Foster Hewitt's radio broadcasts were heard coast-to-coast starting in 1933.\n\npassage title: 1998 Stanley Cup Finals\nThe 1998 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1997–1998 season, and the culmination of the 1998 Stanley Cup playoffs.

According to the \"Batman\" DVD Special Edition, Elfman said that producer Jon Peters was not sure about him as a composer until Tim Burton made him play the main titles.

Elfman's \"The Batman Theme\" went on to become an iconic piece.  It served as the basis for the theme music of \"\", which premiered in 1992, although this was later changed.

The song was also included on the ballads compilation \"Something to Remember\" (1995) and the greatest hits compilation \"Celebration\" (2009).  Producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber, along with music director Phil Ramone, decided to use Madonna after listening to her previous recordings, employing John Bettis and Jon Lind to write the song.  After reading the script of the film, Bettis and Lind wrote the song about the situation in which the lead characters meet at a nightclub.  Initial recording sessions did not impress Bettis and Lind, and they felt that \"Crazy for You\" would be dropped from the soundtrack.  However, a new version was recorded to their liking.\n</doc>\n<Question>: The 1989 Batman film was produced by Jon Peters and a man that is the CEO of what company?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"According to the passage, Jon Peters produced the 1989 Batman film.

Its chemical structure is similar to that of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), with which it shares properties like dimensional stability and chemical resistance.  PCT is also particularly resistant to high temperatures and hydrolysis.  The melting point is 545 °F (285 °C).  Common brand names are \"Thermx\" (Ticona), \"Eastar\" (Eastman) and \"SkyPURA\" (SK Chemicals).\n\npassage title: BoPET\nBoPET (Biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate) is a polyester film made from stretched polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and is used for its high tensile strength, chemical and dimensional stability, transparency, reflectivity, gas and aroma barrier properties, and electrical insulation.\n\npassage title: Xenoy\nXenoy is a blend of plastics with many industrially-useful properties.  It is typically polyester (polybutylene terephthalate, PBT, or polyethylene terephthalate, PET) and polycarbonate (PC): it is often labeled PBT+PC or PET+PC.\n\npassage title: Polytrimethylene terephthalate\nPolytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT), is a polyester synthesized and patented in 1941.  It is produced by a method called condensation polymerization or transesterification.  The two monomer units used in producing this polymer are: 1,3-propanediol and terephthalic acid or dimethyl terephthalate.  Similar to polyethylene terephthalate, the PTT is used to make carpet fibers.\n\npassage title: Two-liter bottle\nThe two-liter bottle is a common container for soft drinks.  These bottles are produced from polyethylene terephthalate, also known as PET plastic, using the blow molding process.  Bottle labels consist of a printed, tight-fitted plastic sleeve.

As an aromatic polyester from ethylene glycol it is a chemical analogue of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN).  PEF has been described in (patent) literature since 1951, but has gained renewed attention since the US department of energy proclaimed its building block, FDCA, as a potential bio-based replacement for purified terephthalic acid (PTA) in 2004.\n\npassage title: Polyethylene naphthalate\nPolyethylene naphthalate (poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalate or PEN) is a polyester with good barrier properties (even better than Polyethylene terephthalate).  Because it provides a very good oxygen barrier, it is particularly well-suited for bottling beverages that are susceptible to oxidation, such as beer.  It is also used in making high performance sailcloth.  It also has been found to show supreme scintillation properties and is expected to replace classic plastic scintillators.\n\npassage title: Krones\nKrones AG is a German packaging and bottling machine manufacturer.  It is the world's leading manufacturer of lines for filling beverages in plastic and glass bottles or beverage cans.  The company manufactures stretch blow-moulding machines for producing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, plus fillers, labellers, bottle washers, pasteurisers, inspectors, packers and palletisers.

The name \"Vinylmation\" is a combination of the word \"Animation\" and \"Vinyl\".  Most figures are all shaped with the body of Mickey Mouse but have different themed markings, colors, and patterns.  This means that all figures have round mouse ears, whether or not the painted character has them.  This is accommodated by painting the ears with backgrounds - stars, stripes, rainbows - to match the painted character.  The series exception is the Park Starz series which does not resemble Mickey at all, and more closely resembles iconic figures from the parks.  Vinylmation was first introduced in July 2008, and the first figures were introduced in November 2008.\n\npassage title: Creedence Clearwater Revisited\nCreedence Clearwater Revisited is an American rock band formed in 1995 by two former members of Creedence Clearwater Revival – a much more well-known band with a very similar name.

The result was yet another multi-platinum successful cross-media enterprise by Warner Bros., in the vein of \"Purple Rain\".  The album was No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" albums chart for six consecutive weeks.  It has sold over eleven million copies worldwide.  In 2016, film critic Matt Zoller Seitz praised Prince's songs and music videos for \"Batman\", more so than the film itself, stating that his songs \"suggest a goofy, perverse, sensuous, somewhat introverted Batman film that so far we've never gotten from anyone\", and arguing that Prince's music videos \"are more psychologically perceptive than any of the Batman films.\"\n\npassage title: Impossible Dream\nImpossible Dream is Patty Griffin’s fifth commercially released album, and fourth studio album.

It plays during the opening sequence and was composed by Danny Elfman in 1989, after series creator Matt Groening approached him requesting a retro-style theme.  The piece, which took 3 days, 2 hours, 48 minutes, and 19 seconds to create, has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.  The theme, as used for the opening sequence, was re-arranged during season 2, and the current arrangement by Alf Clausen was introduced at the beginning of the third season.\n\npassage title: Musical composition\nMusical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music.  People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.\n\npassage title: Batman (score)\nBatman: Original Motion Picture Score is the score album for the 1989 film \"Batman\" by Danny Elfman.  According to the \"Batman\" DVD Special Edition, Elfman said that producer Jon Peters was not sure about him as a composer until Tim Burton made him play the main titles.  Elfman admitted he was stunned when Peters announced that the score would be released on its own album, as releasing a separate score album for a film was something that was rarely done in the 1980s.  Elfman's \"The Batman Theme\" went on to become an iconic piece.  It served as the basis for the theme music of \"\", which premiered in 1992, although this was later changed.  Some parts of the Elfman score are also heard in \"\", \"\" and \"\".  Parts are also played in the queue, and on the station platform of Batman the Ride at various Six Flags theme parks.\n\npassage title: Jimmy Bryant (singer)\nJames Howard Bryant (born June 2, 1929) is a singer, arranger and composer.

They were enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Parliament of Canada.  In Canada, some of the Acts were amended or repealed by the Constitution Act, 1982.  The rest were renamed in Canada as the \"Constitution Acts\".  In the United Kingdom, those Acts that were passed by the British Parliament remain under their original names.  The term \"British North America\" (BNA) refers to the British colonies in North America.\n\npassage title: Canada under British rule\nCanada first came under British rule with the Treaty of Paris (1763) which ceded New France, of which Canada was a part, to the British Empire.  Gradually, other territories, colonies, and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada.  The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas.  With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada.  Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.  A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation.  Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949.  Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.  This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom, and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  Canada's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act, subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom.\n\npassage title: Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps\nThe Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps was created as a registered charity under the \"Bermuda Sea Cadet Association Act, 1968\".

Sikh History is around 500 years and in that time the Sikhs have developed unique expressions of art and culture which are influenced by their faith and synthesize traditions from many other cultures.  Sikhism is Punjab's only indigenous religion with all other religions coming from outside Punjab (with the possible exception of Punjabi Hinduism since the oldest Hindu scripture – the Rig Veda – was composed in the Punjab region.  Some other religions, like Jainism, may also claim to have originated in Punjab since Jain symbolism has been found among artifacts of the Indus Valley Civilization).  All the Sikh gurus, saints and majority of the martyrs in Sikh history were from Punjab and from the Punjabi people.  Punjabi culture and Sikhism are considered inseparably intertwined.  \"Sikh\" properly refers to adherents of Sikhism as a religion, not an ethnic group.  However, because Sikhism has seldom sought converts, most Sikhs share strong ethno-religious ties.  Many countries, such as the U.K., therefore recognize Sikh as a designated ethnicity on their censuses.  The American non-profit organization United Sikhs has fought to have Sikh included on the U.S. census as well, arguing that Sikhs \"self-identify as an 'ethnic minority'\" and believe \"that they are more than just a religion\".\n\npassage title: Omid Safi\nOmid Safi is an American Professor of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at Duke University, where he is the Director of Duke Islamic Studies Center, and a columnist for On Being.

His papacy was marked by an active foreign policy, ambitious building projects, and patronage of the arts—he commissioned the destruction and rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, and Michelangelo's decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.  In addition to an active military policy, he personally led troops into battle on at least two occasions, the first to expel Giovanni Bentivoglio from Bologna (17 August 1506–23 March 1507), and the second in an attempt to recover Ferrara for the Papal States (1 September 1510–29 June 1512).\n\npassage title: Portrait of Pope Julius II\nPortrait of Pope Julius II is an oil painting of 1511–12 by the Italian High Renaissance painter Raphael.
