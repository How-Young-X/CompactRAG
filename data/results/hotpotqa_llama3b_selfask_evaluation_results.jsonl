A related topic is regression analysis, which focuses more on questions of statistical inference such as how much uncertainty is present in a curve that is fit to data observed with random errors.  Fitted curves can be used as an aid for data visualization, to infer values of a function where no data are available, and to summarize the relationships among two or more variables.

In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.

The song is notable for its combination of two singers associated with the outlaw movement with a country legend from the honky tonk days and golden age of the Grand Ole Opry.  Outlaw singers like Williams and Jennings saw themselves as taking country music back to its raw, honky tonk roots, and recording an up tempo song with Tubb (who would never have received radio airplay in the late 1970s and early 80's) and reaching #6 was a slap in the face to the proponents of the country pop sound.  The lyrics of the song, much like Williams' \"Family Tradition\" echo the sentiment that the outlaw singers and their current escapades were predated by the hard living honky tonkers of the 1950s such as Hank Williams, Sr. and Ernest Tubb, prior to the music being fairly taken over by the Nashville Sound in the 1960s.", "meta": {"title": "L", "id": "e"}, "score": 0.363418847322464}, {"text": "passage title: My Love (Little Texas song)\n\"My Love\" is a song recorded by the American country music band Little Texas.

The group was started by Ezra Cline and Curly Ray Cline and was originally named \"Cousin Ezra and the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers\".  The Clines came from a large family consisting of musically talented people.  Ray and Charlie's father, Charlie, was a talented banjo player and the women in the family, Geraldine and Bobbi, were great singers.  For reasons unknown, Bobbi and Geraldine never joined the band on the road but often joined in at home, especially when notable Country singers, such as Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, and Hank Williams, came visiting.  None of them ever had a music lesson yet excelled on every instrument they touched.  Natives of the Gilbert Creek region of southern West Virginia, Cousin Ezra, along with brothers Ireland (Lazy Ned) and Curly Ray Cline, were part of the original Lonesome Pine Fiddlers from about 1938, a group that worked on radio at WHIS Bluefield, West Virginia.  During World War II, Ned was killed in action.  When the Pine Fiddlers resumed regular daily broadcasts, Charlie, who played multiple instruments, joined them on a regular basis.  Charlie returned to the Fiddlers briefly before becoming a member of Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys.  During 1952-1955, Charlie worked off and on with Monroe, recording some 38 songs, all on Decca.  It has been said that he played every instrument at one time or another in the Monroe group except mandolin.  Charlie spent most of 1953 back with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers working at WJR radio in Detroit.  When Ezra brought the band to Pikeville, Kentucky, in November, Charlie rejoined Bill Monroe.  In 1954, Charlie did a session, playing lead guitar, with the Stanley Brothers and also another one on RCA with the Fiddlers, although he was not otherwise working with them at the time.  He also worked briefly as a sideman with the Osborne Brothers, although he did not record with them.  By 1958, Charlie (electric lead guitar) and his wife, Lee (electric bass), had rejoined Ezra and Curly Ray in the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, who were experimenting with a more modern sound and working a TV show in Huntington, West Virginia, in addition to daily radio in Pikeville.  In his later years, Charlie was with the Stanley Brothers.  Curly Ray also played with the Stanley Brothers at a different time as their fiddler.  Curly Ray was one of the best fiddlers in Bluegrass.  This most talented family of musicians were the best, surpassed by none.  Finally, on October 1, 2009, The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers got their due when they were inducted into the International Bluegrass Hall of Fame at the Ryman Theater (the original home of the Grand Ole Opry).  Bobby Osborne, Melvin Goins and Paul Williams were there to receive the bands award.  In the crowd of a sold out theater was the son of Ezra Cline, Scotty Ireland Cline, who recalled being in that same theater as a child sitting on stage and watching the Fiddlers play.  (At the time, the Opry had bleachers for family just off stage).

The NHL first expanded into the United States in 1924 with the founding of the Boston Bruins, and by 1926 consisted of ten teams in Ontario, Quebec, the Great Lakes region, and the Northeastern United States.  At the same time, the NHL emerged as the only major league and the sole competitor for the Stanley Cup; in 1947, the NHL completed a deal with the Stanley Cup trustees to gain full control of the Cup.

What we put forward is our best effort at what we want to say about who we are.  Yet while we intend to convey one impression, our performance is not always interpreted as we might expect.  Through learning to make sense of others’ responses to our behavior, we can assess how well we have conveyed what we intended.  We can then alter our performance accordingly.  This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment is what Erving Goffman calls impression management.  Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation through their behavior.

With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada.

The term was first adapted into sociology from the theatre by Erving Goffman, who developed most of the related terminology and ideas in his 1959 book, \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\".  Kenneth Burke, whom Goffman would later acknowledge as an influence, had earlier presented his notions of dramatism in 1945, which in turn derives from Shakespeare.  However, the fundamental difference between Burke's and Goffman's view is that Burke believed that life was in fact theatre, whereas Goffman viewed theatre as a metaphor.

In conveying who we are to other people, we use our bodies to project information about ourselves.  This is done through movement, clothes, speech, and facial expressions.  What we put forward is our best effort at what we want to say about who we are.  Yet while we intend to convey one impression, our performance is not always interpreted as we might expect.  Through learning to make sense of others’ responses to our behavior, we can assess how well we have conveyed what we intended.  We can then alter our performance accordingly.  This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment is what Erving Goffman calls impression management.  Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation through their behavior.

The nominations for this Academy Award are determined by a ballot of the voting members of the Editing Branch of the Academy; there were 220 members of the Editing Branch in 2012.  The members may vote for up to five of the eligible films in the order of their preference; the five films with the largest vote totals are selected as nominees.  The Academy Award itself is selected from the nominated films by a subsequent ballot of all active and life members of the Academy.

In conveying who we are to other people, we use our bodies to project information about ourselves.  This is done through movement, clothes, speech, and facial expressions.  What we put forward is our best effort at what we want to say about who we are.  Yet while we intend to convey one impression, our performance is not always interpreted as we might expect.  Through learning to make sense of others’ responses to our behavior, we can assess how well we have conveyed what we intended.  We can then alter our performance accordingly.  This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment is what Erving Goffman calls impression management.  Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation through their behavior.  People seek to define social situations by using contextual cues from the environment around them.  Social norms emerge from situational definitions, as people learn to read cues from the environment and the people present to understand what is appropriate behavior.", "meta": {"title": "I", "id": "d"}, "score": 0.286793977022171}], "total_input_tokens": 5598, "total_output_tokens": 9128, "total_tokens": 14726, "total_time_consumed": 80.47979831695557, "step_stats": [{"step": 1, "type": "main_reasoning", "input_tokens": 627, "output_tokens": 8573}, {"step": 1, "type": "retrieval", "input_tokens": 1415, "output_tokens": 79}, {"step": 2, "type": "main_reasoning", "input_tokens": 710, "output_tokens": 99}, {"step": 3, "type": "main_reasoning", "input_tokens": 710, "output_tokens": 99}, {"step": 4, "type": "main_reasoning", "input_tokens": 710, "output_tokens": 99}, {"step": 5, "type": "main_reasoning", "input_tokens": 710, "output_tokens": 99}, {"step": 7, "type": "final_answer", "input_tokens": 716, "output_tokens": 80}]}

People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.

The principes of using the kite is the same, but in different terrain.  In the early days of snowkiting, foil kites were the most common type; nowadays many kiteboarders use inflatable kites.  However, since 2013, newly developed racing foil kites seem to dominate speed races and expedition races, like Red Bull Ragnarok (held on the Norwegian Hardangervidda plateau) and the Vake mini-expedition race (held at Norway's most northern Varanger peninsula).  Snowkiting differs from other alpine sports in that it is possible for the snowkiter to travel uphill and downhill with any wind direction.  Like kiteboarding, snowkiting can be very hazardous and should be learned and practiced with care.  Snowkiting is becoming increasingly popular in places often associated with skiing and snowboarding, such as Russia, Canada, Iceland, France, Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Sweden and the Northern and Central United States.
