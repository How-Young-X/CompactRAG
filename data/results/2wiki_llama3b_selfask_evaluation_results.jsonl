Hoping to reach a wide audience, the director forsook his usual practice of emphasizing groups by concentrating on a single rural heroine. Eisenstein briefly abandoned this project to film , in honour of the 10th anniversary of the Revolution. By the time he was able to return to this film, the Party's attitudes had changed and Trotsky had fallen from grace. As a result, the film was hastily re-edited and sent out in 1929 under a new title, \"The Old and the New\". In later years, archivists restored \"The General Line\" to an approximation of Eisenstein's original concept.

Her youth is well documented in the ancient reliefs and paintings of the reign of her parents.

It is also possible that she was briefly married to Tutankhamun's successor, Ay, believed by some to be her maternal grandfather.

If so, this would make Phintys a Spartan, and date her birth to the late fifth century BC, and her floruit to the fourth century. I. M. Plant considers this emendation \"fanciful\". Iamblichus mentions Philtys in his list of female Pythagoreans; he says that she was from Croton and that her father was called Theophrius. I. M. Plant believes that Iamblichus' Philtys, though also a Pythagorean and similarly named, is distinct from Stobaeus' Phintys. Two fragments attributed to Phintys are preserved in Stobaeus. However, not all scholars agree that the fragments are authentic: Lefkowitz and Fant argue that the works attributed to female Pythagoreans, including Phintys, were actually rhetorical exercises written by men. They are written in the Doric dialect, and amount to about 80 lines of prose. The language used dates to around the fourth century BC, although some features of it appear to be deliberate archaisms; it was likely actually composed in the third century BC, though a date as late as the second century AD was suggested by Friedrich Wilhelm in 1915. The fragments discuss the differences between men and women, and argues for chastity as the most important virtue for women. She gives a series of ways that women ought to practice self-control, concluding that the most effective way is to only have sex with her husband in order to produce legitimate children. Along with her defence of women's chastity, Phintys argues that the practice of philosophy is appropriate for women as well as men.", "meta": {"title": "P", "id": "h"}, "score": 0.29233694076538086}, {"text": "passage title: Empress Shōken\n, also known as, was the wife of Emperor Meiji of Japan.", "meta": {"title": "E", "id": "m"}, "score": 0.2640734910964966}, {"text": "passage title: Wizards of the Demon Sword\nWizards of the Demon Sword is a 1991 film directed by Fred Olen Ray and starring Russ Tamblyn.", "meta": {"title": "W", "id": "i"}, "score": 0.25951889157295227}, {"text": "passage title: The Police Serve the Citizens?\nLa polizia è al servizio del cittadino?

Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until Pakistan's creation on 14 August 1947, and then as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death. He is revered in Pakistan as \"Quaid-i-AzamGreat Leader\") and \"Baba-i-QaumFather of the Nation\"). His birthday is considered a national holiday in Pakistan. Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his return to British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of \"satyagraha\", which he regarded as political anarchy. By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that Muslims of the Indian subcontinent should have their own state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation. During the Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula for the subcontinent to be united as a single state, leading all parties to agree to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan. As the first Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from the new nation of India to Pakistan after independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable streets, roads and localities in the world are named after Jinnah. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name.

Francis Rákóczi was the son of George Rákóczi II, prince of Transylvania, and Sophia Báthory. He was elected prince by the Transylvanian Diet in 1652, during his father's life. However, because of the disastrous Polish campaign of 1657 and its consequences, the Ottoman Empire removed his father from the throne in 1660, and prohibited any Rákóczi to ascend the Transylvanian throne. This left Francis unable to come by his father's legacy; he therefore withdrew to his estates in Royal Hungary. Notably, the Rákóczi family was Calvinist, and they were staunch supporters of the Reformed Church in Hungary. However, Francis' mother, Sophia Báthory, had converted to Calvinism merely for the sake of her marriage. After her husband's death, she returned to Catholicism and supported the Counter Reformation. Francis Rákóczi also became a Catholic, thus acquiring favour with the Catholic Habsburg Court. His mother converted him to Catholicism. He was made a count in 1664. In 1666 Francis married Jelena Zrinska (Hungarian: Zrínyi Ilona), a Croatian countess, and joined the Wesselényi conspiracy (\"Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy\" in Croatia), one leader of which was Jelena's father, Petar Zrinski (Hungarian: Zrínyi Péter). Francis soon became the leader of the conspiracy, and, as a culmination of their anti-Habsburg stratagems, started an armed uprising of nobles in Upper Hungary, while the other conspirators were supposed to start the fight in Croatia. Due to poor organization and discord between the conspirators, however, the Austrian authorities were well informed; they quickly suppressed the Croatian branch of the revolt. When Rákóczi learned that Petar Zrinski had been captured by the Austrians, he laid down his arms and applied for mercy. All other leaders of the conspiracy were executed for high treason; Rákóczi, due to his mother's intervention, and for a ransom of 300,000 forints and several castles, was pardoned.", "meta": {"title": "F", "id": "r"}, "score": 0.5032206773757935}, {"text": "passage title: Ilona Zrínyi\nCountess Ilona Zrínyi (Croatian: \"Jelena Zrinska\", Hungarian: \"Zrínyi Ilona\") (1643, Ozalj – 18 February 1703, Izmit) was a noblewoman and heroine.

He was a son of Emperor Iyasu I and brother to Emperors Tekle Haymanot I and Dawit III. James Bruce describes Bakaffa as faced with the increasing enfeeblement of the Ethiopian Empire as well as growing intrigue and conspiracies. To respond to these challenges, writes Bruce, Bakaffa was \"silent, secret, and unfathomable in his designs, surrounded by soldiers who were his own slaves, and by new men of his own creation. \" In writing his account of this Emperor's reign, Bruce claims that at the time of his writing no \"Royal Chronicle\" of his reign existed, because it \"would have been a very dangerous book to have been kept in Bacuffa's time; and, accordingly, no person chose ever to run that risk; and the king's particular behaviour afterwards had still the further effect, that nobody would supply this deficiency after his death, a general belief prevailing in Abyssinia that he is alive to this day, and will appear again in all his terrors. \" As a result, Bruce's account of Bakaffa's reign consists of a collection of impressionistic vignettes of selected events—his travels through Ethiopia in disguise, his feigned death, his first meetings with people who were to play an important role during his rule—which support this portrait. In contrast, the editor of the 1805 edition of Bruce's work, Alexander Murray, excised all but the first two paragraphs of his chapter on this ruler, replacing Bruce's material with a summary of a chronicle of the reign, stating that \"the annals of this period are very complete, the public transactions of Bacuffa are well known, though his motives seldom escaped from his own impenetrable breast.\"", "meta": {"title": "B", "id": "a"}, "score": 0.3817712962627411}, {"text": "passage title: Tafasiry\nTafasiry is a 2007 film.", "meta": {"title": "T", "id": "a"}, "score": 0.3300049304962158}, {"text": "passage title: Rakka (film)\nThe film was released on YouTube and Steam on 14 June 2017.", "meta": {"title": "R", "id": "a"}, "score": 0.326479434967041}, {"text": "passage title: Minamoto no Chikako\nShe was the mother of Prince Morinaga.", "meta": {"title": "M", "id": "i"}, "score": 0.3222980201244354}, {"text": "passage title: Love Is in the Hair\nLove Is in the Hair is a 2016 Nigerian romantic- comedy film produced by Emem Isong and directed by Ansa Kpokpogri.", "meta": {"title": "L", "id": "o"}, "score": 0.3153918981552124}, {"text": "passage title: Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (born 1982)\nPrince Leka of Albania (\"Leka Anwar Zog Reza Baudouin Msiziwe Zogu\", born 26 March 1982) is the only child of the first Leka, Crown Prince of Albania, and Susan Cullen-Ward.

She married in 1579 with Count Palatine John I \"the lame\" of Zweibrücken. Emperor Charles V had in 1546 granted the Duchy of Jülich-Cleves-Berg the right of female succession. So, when her brother, Duke John William, died in 1609 without a male heir of his own, both she and William's daughters could play a vital role in the question of who would inherit the important northwest German territory. Magdalene's husband John claimed the inheritance for Palatinate-Zweibrücken, as did the Elector of Brandenburg, John Sigismund, who was married to Anna, a daughter of Magdalena's sister Marie Eleonore (John Sigismund claimed his marriage contract from 1573 gave him the best claim). The third claimant was Count Palatine Philip Louis of Neuburg, the husband of Magdalen's other sister Anna. Finally, the Duchy of Saxony claimed Jülich-Cleves-Berg, based on an agreement to that effect with the Emperor. Since all claimants were members of comprehensive European coalitions and so the Habsburgs and France were indirectly involved, an international conflict threatened: the War of the Jülich succession. However, after King Henry IV of France died, the conflict could be settled provisionally by the Treaty of Xanten. The duchy was divided between Brandenburg and Palatinate-Neuburg.

Abercrombie was the illegitimate son of James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton. He joined the Royal Scots as an ensign on 24 May 1696, and fought in the Battle of Blenheim in 1704 as Aide-de-Camp to George Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney. He became brevet major in 1706 and captain on 31 May 1707. He was created baronet on 21 May 1709. He subsequently served as a captain and lieutenant-colonel in the Coldstream Guards from 1710 to 1711. Abercrombie was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dysart Burghs at a by-election on 16 January 1710 and held the seat until the dissolution of parliament on 21 September 1710. He chose not to stand for re-election, and his successor as the member for Dysart Burghs, James Oswald, was elected unopposed at the 1710 British general election. Abercrombie became lieutenant-colonel on 20 March 1711 and brevet colonel on 1 November 1711. On 24 October 1712, he became Town Major (Lieutenant-Governor) of Dunkirk and as such, oversaw the evacuation of French forces and the installation of an allied garrison, holding the post for the rest of his life. He was commissioner for inspecting the demolition of Dunkirk fortifications from 1713 to 1716, accumulating extensive arrears of pay and allowance. He spent some time chasing what he was owed, and had to sell his regiment to make ends meet. Abercrombie was probably unmarried and died without surviving male issue at his home in Charing Cross on 14 November 1724.
