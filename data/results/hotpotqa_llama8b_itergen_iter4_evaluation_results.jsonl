This grouping was designed to fill a perceived gap between the formal rank of subfamily and tribes.  In his treatment of this family, he divided it first into four subfamiles.  Within subfamily Amarylloideae he then divided his sixteen tribes into two infrafamilies, Amarylloidinae (12 tribes) and Pancratioidinae (4 tribes), both of which were subsequently demonstrated to be polyphyletic, and hence were abandoned by Dahlgren, who used no rank between family and tribe.  On the other hand, he also used a much more restricted Amaryllidaceae corresponding to Traub's subfamily Amarylloideae.  Thus Traub's Amarylloideae most closely resembles subfamily Amaryllidoideae \"sensu\" APGIII.\n</doc>\n<Question>: What family are the genus' Sinofranchetia and Stauntonia from?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"According to the passage, Sinofranchetia and Stauntonia are both flowering plants in the Lardizabalaceae family.\",\n    \"answer\": \"Lardizabalaceae\"\n}\n```", "total_input_tokens": 3742, "total_output_tokens": 326, "total_tokens": 4068, "total_time_consumed": 6.233947992324829, "iteration_stats": [{"iteration": 1, "input_tokens": 1091, "output_tokens": 79}, {"iteration": 2, "input_tokens": 775, "output_tokens": 89}, {"iteration": 3, "input_tokens": 933, "output_tokens": 102}, {"iteration": 4, "input_tokens": 943, "output_tokens": 56}]}

Note that Bartók started three times anew with opus numbers, here indicated with \"(list 1)\", \"(list 2)\" and \"(list 3)\" respectively.

Notable composers who have been influenced by them include Benjamin Britten, particularly in the Sonata in C for Cello and Piano (; ), Elliott Carter, who refers in the opening of his own First String Quartet to Bartók’s Sixth Quartet , Chen Yi , Edison Denisov, whose Second Quartet is closely related to Bartók’s Fifth Quartet , Franco Donatoni, who was deeply impressed when he heard a broadcast of Bartók's Fourth Quartet , Robert Fripp, who mentions them as an influence upon King Crimson , Miloslav Ištvan , György Kurtág, whose Opp.  1 and 28 both owe a great deal to Bartók's quartets (; ), György Ligeti, whose two string quartets both owe a great deal to Bartók’s quartets (; ), Bruno Maderna , George Perle, who credits the Bartók Fourth and Fifth Quartets as precedents for his use of arrays of chords related to one another by different types of symmetry , Walter Piston (; ), Kim Dzmitrïyevich Tsesakow , Wilfried Westerlinck , Stefan Wolpe, who explained in a public lecture how he had derived ideas from Bartók’s Fourth Quartet , and Xu Yongsan .\n\npassage title: Suite, Op. 14 (Bartók)\nThe Suite, Op. 14, Sz.  62, BB 70 is a piece for solo piano written by Béla Bartók.

The Suite is one of Bartók's most significant works for piano, only comparable with his 1926 Piano Sonata.  Though much of Bartók's work makes frequent use of Eastern European folk music, this suite is one of the few pieces without melodies of folk origin.  However, Romanian, Arabic, and North African rhythmic influences can still be found in some movements.  Originally intending the suite to be a five-movement work, Bartók later decided against the idea and discarded the second movement, the \"Andante\", which was published only posthumously in the October 1955 issue of \"Új Zenei Szemle\" (New Musical Review).\n</doc>\n<Question>: Are Benjamin Britten and Béla Bartók from the same country?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"Benjamin Britten was an English composer, and Béla Bartók was a Hungarian composer.

The most widely known member is the flat-leaved vanilla (\"V. planifolia\"), native to Mexico, from which commercial vanilla flavoring is derived.  It is the only orchid widely used for industrial purposes in flavoring such products as foods, beverages and cosmetics, and is recognized as the most popular aroma and flavor.  The key constituent imparting its popular characteristics is the phenolic aldehyde, vanillin.\n\npassage title: Vanilla\nVanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \"Vanilla\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\"V. planifolia\").  The word \"vanilla\", derived from \"vainilla\" , the diminutive of the Spanish word \"vaina\" (\"vaina\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \"little pod\".  Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called \"tlilxochitl\" by the Aztecs.  Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.\n\npassage title: Chamelaucium\nChamelaucium, also known as waxflower, is a genus of shrubs endemic to south western Western Australia.  They belong to the myrtle family Myrtaceae and have flowers similar to those of the tea-trees (\"Leptospermum\").  The most well-known species is the Geraldton Wax, \"Chamelaucium uncinatum\", which is cultivated widely for its large attractive flowers.\n\npassage title: Amarylloidinae\nAmarylloidinae is a now obsolete informal name for an \"infrafamily\" within the Amaryllidaceae (Amaryllis) family, erected by Hamilton Traub.  This grouping was designed to fill a perceived gap between the formal rank of subfamily and tribes.  In his treatment of this family, he divided it first into four subfamiles.  Within subfamily Amarylloideae he then divided his sixteen tribes into two infrafamilies, Amarylloidinae (12 tribes) and Pancratioidinae (4 tribes), both of which were subsequently demonstrated to be polyphyletic, and hence were abandoned by Dahlgren, who used no rank between family and tribe.  On the other hand, he also used a much more restricted Amaryllidaceae corresponding to Traub's subfamily Amarylloideae.  Thus Traub's Amarylloideae most closely resembles subfamily Amaryllidoideae \"sensu\" APGIII.\n\npassage title: Caryophyllales\nCaryophyllales ( ) is an order of flowering plants that includes the cacti, carnations, amaranths, ice plants, beets, and many carnivorous plants.

Patent no: US726793 A, which was bought by the founder of the La Pavoni company which from 1905 produced espresso machines commercially on a small scale in Milan.  Multiple machine designs have been created to produce espresso.  Several machines share some common elements, such as a grouphead and a portafilter.

This demonstrated that the Stenomesseae tribe, including the type genus \"Stenomesson\" was polyphyletic.  Part of the tribe segregated with the Eucharideae and were submerged into it, while the other part formed a unique subclade.  Since the type species of \"Stenomesson\" was not part of the second sublclade it was necessary to form a new name for the remaining species together with the other genera that remained.

There is a noted professional rivalry between them – between the 2001 US Open and the 2017 Australian Open tournaments, they met in nine Grand Slam singles finals.  They became the first two players, female or male, to play in 4 consecutive grand slam singles finals from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all 4 to complete the first of two \"Serena Slams\".  Between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year span, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus won 5 and Serena won 7).

The charts are commercial monitoring and marketing devices used by the UK music industry to measure its effectiveness in promoting and selling albums, nominally in the field of classical music.  All three charts are compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC).  The measurements are made by collating the returns of sales from a number of well-known music stores (high street and online stores) on a regular basis, and this enables a ranking to be established.  Most classical artist album sales in the UK are from crossover artists.  For an album to be classified as classical in the charts, it has to have 60% of the playing time dedicated to \"classical or traditional music\".  Only albums that entirely classical or traditional music qualify for inclusion in the Specialist Classical Albums Chart.\n\npassage title: The Friendly Guide to Music\nThe Friendly Guide to Music is a 'beginner's guide' to classical music, voiced by English actor and presenter Tony Robinson.  It covers the period from early music, Medieval and Renaissance music, to the modern era, 20th-century classical music, contemporary classical music, and 21st-century classical music, and its objective is to create a guide to music that is not needlessly complex.\n\npassage title: Canadian classical music\nIn Canada, classical music includes a range of musical styles rooted in the traditions of Western or European classical music that European settlers brought to the country from the 17th century and onwards.  As well, it includes musical styles brought by other ethnic communities from the 19th century and onwards, such as Indian classical music (Hindustani and Carnatic music) and Chinese classical music.  Since Canada's emergence as a nation in 1867, the country has produced its own composers, musicians and ensembles.  As well, it has developed a music infrastructure that includes training institutions, conservatories, performance halls, and a public radio broadcaster, CBC, which programs a moderate amount of Classical music.  There is a high level of public interest in classical music and education.\n\npassage title: Musical composition\nMusical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music.  People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Are Even and Incubus known for their skill in classical music?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"Incubus is an American rock band, not a classical music group.

She became famous as a candidate for the 1958 São Paulo city council elections with the intention of protesting against political corruption.  Electoral officials did not accept Cacareco's candidacy, but she eventually won 100,000 votes, more than any other party in that same election (which was also marked by rampant absenteeism).  Today, the term \"voto Cacareco\" (Cacareco vote) is commonly used to describe protest votes in Brazil.  Cacareco's candidacy inspired the Rhinoceros Party of Canada, nominally led by the rhinoceros Cornelius the First.\n\npassage title: Rhinoceros Party of Canada (1963–93)\nThe Rhinoceros Party (French: \"Parti Rhinocéros\") was a registered political party in Canada from the 1960s to the 1990s.  Operating within the tradition of political satire, the Rhinoceros Party's basic credo, their so-called primal promise, was \"a promise to keep none of our promises\".  They then promised outlandishly impossible schemes designed to amuse and entertain the voting public.\n\npassage title: Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada\nThe Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada, or RCP Canada, is a revolutionary communist party oriented around Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.  The creation of the organizational stage of the Party was adopted at what was called the \"Revolutionary Communist Conference\", which was held in Montreal, Quebec in November 2000 by activists and former members of the labour union movements and youth organizations of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, who felt that the revolutionary situation in Canada warranted the creation of a Party dedicated to a communist revolution.  The party was initially called the Revolutionary Communist Party (Organizing Committees) (RCP(OC)).  At this conference, participants adopted the Party's first Draft Programme.  Because of the location of the conference, the majority of the founding members were French-speaking Quebecers, and the Party began an extensive effort to reach out to the rest of Canada, starting with the Canadian Revolutionary Congress held in November 2006 in Toronto.  It is not recognized as a political party by Elections Canada, because the party rejects what it calls the \"bourgeois electoral system\" and doesn't seek recognition by the State.\n\npassage title: The New Canada\nThe New Canada is a Canadian political literature book written by Reform Party of Canada founder and leader Preston Manning and published by Macmillan Canada.  The book explains the personal, religious, and political life of Preston Manning and explains the roots and beliefs of the Reform Party.  At the time of its publishing in 1992, Reform had become a popular populist conservative party in Western Canada after the mainstream Progressive Conservative Party of Canada was collapsing in support and in 1991 decided to expand eastward into Ontario and the Maritimes.  One year later the PC party collapsed in the 1993 federal election, allowing the Reform Party to make political history in Canada, deplacing the PCs as the dominant conservative party in Canada.  Reform, later renamed the Canadian Alliance, merged with the PC Party in 2003, to form a united right-wing alternative to the governing Liberal Party of Canada, named the Conservative Party of Canada which has dropped many of the populist themes that the Reform Party had.\n\npassage title: Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada\nThe Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada (APP) is a Canadian political party that was founded in 2005.  The party was conceived by University of Lethbridge student Myron Wolf Child.  It held its founding meeting on August 21, 2005, in St. Albert, Alberta.  The APP was headed by interim leader Bill Montour, a former Chief of the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario.  In October 2005, the party had 122 confirmed members, just less than half the number needed to register as an official party in Canada.  In late October 2005, the APP sought to unite with the First Peoples National Party of Canada which also had fewer than the number of confirmed members needed to become a registered political party.  The First Peoples National Party of Canada became an eligible political party on December 6, 2005.  Whether or not this was accomplished through a merger with the APP is unclear.  If this is the case, the APP no longer exists, but, as one of the stipulations of a possible merger was that a name for the new party would be determined at the party's first convention, it is possible that the name Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada will come into usage again.\n</doc>\n<Question>: When did the party inspired by Cacareco begin in Canada?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"Cacareco, a female black rhinoceros, became famous as a candidate for the 1958 São Paulo city council elections.

It was released in May 1983 as the second single from Williams' album \"Strong Stuff\".  The song reached number 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart.  It was written by Williams, Dean Dillon, Gary Stewart and Tanya Tucker.  The song is notable for its combination of two singers associated with the outlaw movement with a country legend from the honky tonk days and golden age of the Grand Ole Opry.  Outlaw singers like Williams and Jennings saw themselves as taking country music back to its raw, honky tonk roots, and recording an up tempo song with Tubb (who would never have received radio airplay in the late 1970s and early 80's) and reaching #6 was a slap in the face to the proponents of the country pop sound.  The lyrics of the song, much like Williams' \"Family Tradition\" echo the sentiment that the outlaw singers and their current escapades were predated by the hard living honky tonkers of the 1950s such as Hank Williams, Sr. and Ernest Tubb, prior to the music being fairly taken over by the Nashville Sound in the 1960s.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Come from the Heart:was first recorded by an artist that sang what genre of music?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"According to the passage, 'Come from the Heart' was first recorded by Don Williams on his 1987 album 'Traces', which is a country music album.\",\n    \"answer\": \"country\"\n}\n```", "total_input_tokens": 4569, "total_output_tokens": 237, "total_tokens": 4806, "total_time_consumed": 4.469218969345093, "iteration_stats": [{"iteration": 1, "input_tokens": 1416, "output_tokens": 72}, {"iteration": 2, "input_tokens": 1047, "output_tokens": 54}, {"iteration": 3, "input_tokens": 1053, "output_tokens": 54}, {"iteration": 4, "input_tokens": 1053, "output_tokens": 57}]}

The term was first adapted into sociology from the theatre by Erving Goffman, who developed most of the related terminology and ideas in his 1959 book, \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\".  Kenneth Burke, whom Goffman would later acknowledge as an influence, had earlier presented his notions of dramatism in 1945, which in turn derives from Shakespeare.  However, the fundamental difference between Burke's and Goffman's view is that Burke believed that life was in fact theatre, whereas Goffman viewed theatre as a metaphor.  If we imagine ourselves as directors observing what goes on in the theatre of everyday life, we are doing what Goffman called dramaturgical analysis, the study of social interaction in terms of theatrical performance.\n\npassage title: The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\nThe Presentation of Self in Everyday Life is a 1956 sociology book by Erving Goffman, in which Goffman uses the imagery of the theatre in order to portray the importance of human social interaction.

Mosley was later replaced by Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton, who added lyrics to the already-written music for 1989's \"The Real Thing\".

This term comes from the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the British parliament.\n\npassage title: Politics of Canada\nThe politics of Canada function within a framework of parliamentary democracy and a federal system of parliamentary government with strong democratic traditions.  Canada is a constitutional monarchy, in which the Monarch is head of state.  The country has a multi-party system in which many of its legislative practices derive from the unwritten conventions of and precedents set by the United Kingdom's Westminster Parliament.  However, Canada has evolved variations: party discipline in Canada is stronger than in the United Kingdom and more parliamentary votes are considered motions of confidence, which tends to diminish the role of non-Cabinet Members of Parliament, (MPs).  Such members, in the government caucus, and junior or lower-profile members of opposition caucuses, are known as backbenchers. Backbenchers can, however, exert their influence by sitting in parliamentary committees, like the Public Accounts Committee or the National-Defence Committee.\n\npassage title: Canada under British rule\nCanada first came under British rule with the Treaty of Paris (1763) which ceded New France, of which Canada was a part, to the British Empire.  Gradually, other territories, colonies, and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada.  The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas.  With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada.  Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.  A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation.  Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949.  Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.  This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom, and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  Canada's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act, subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom.\n\npassage title: Governance of England\nThere has not been a government of England since 1707 when the Kingdom of England ceased to exist as a sovereign state, as it merged with the Kingdom of Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.  Kingdom of Great Britain continued from 1707 until 1801 when it merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which itself became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) in 1922 (in reality; in name in 1927) upon independence for most of the island of Ireland.  The UK since then has gone through significant change to its system of government, with devolved parliaments, assemblies and governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  England, however, remains under the full jurisdiction, on all matters, of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the UK government as no devolved administration has been created for England within the new structure.  This situation has led to the anomaly, known as the West Lothian question, which is that Scottish Members of Parliament (MPs) are able to vote on legislation that affects only England whereas English MPs can not vote on certain Scottish matters due to devolution.  In some cases, such as top-up university tuition fees and foundation hospitals, the votes of Scottish MPs have been crucial in helping pass legislation for England that the majority of English MPs have opposed.\n\npassage title: Quebec Legislature\nThe Quebec Legislature (officially Parliament of Quebec, French: \"Parlement du Québec\" ) is the legislature of the province of Quebec, Canada, since Confederation in 1867.  Today, the legislature is made of two elements: the monarch of Canada, represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, and the unicameral assembly called the National Assembly of Quebec.  The legislature has existed since 1867 when Quebec, then called Canada East, became one of the founding colonies of Canadian Confederation.  From 1867 until 1968 the legislature was bicameral, containing a lower chamber called the Legislative Assembly of Quebec and an upper chamber called the Legislative Council of Quebec.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Which system of parliament was modeled after the United Kingdom and is also used in Canada? \nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"The Westminster system is a parliamentary system of government modelled after that which developed in the United Kingdom.

He played parts of 17 seasons in the National Hockey League's (NHL) with the Pittsburgh Penguins, between 1984 and 2006.  Dubbed \"The Magnificent One\" or \"Le Magnifique\" (as well as \"Super Mario\"), he is widely acknowledged to have been one of the best players of all time.  He is the only player to score one goal in each of the five possible situations in a single NHL game, a feat he accomplished in 1988.  A gifted playmaker and fast skater despite his large size, Lemieux often beat defencemen with fakes and dekes.\n\npassage title: 1992 Stanley Cup Finals\nThe 1992 Stanley Cup Finals NHL championship series was contested by the Prince of Wales Conference and defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins and the Clarence Campbell Conference champion Chicago Blackhawks.

He has also served as head coach of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, whom he helped to the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals.\n\npassage title: History of the National Hockey League\nThe history of the National Hockey League begins with the end of its predecessor league, the National Hockey Association (NHA), in 1917.  After unsuccessfully attempting to resolve disputes with Eddie Livingstone, owner of the Toronto Blueshirts, executives of the three other NHA franchises suspended the NHA, and formed the National Hockey League (NHL), replacing the Livingstone team with a temporary team in Toronto, the Arenas.  The NHL's first quarter-century saw the league compete against two rival major leagues—the Pacific Coast Hockey Association and Western Canada Hockey League—for players and the Stanley Cup.  The NHL first expanded into the United States in 1924 with the founding of the Boston Bruins, and by 1926 consisted of ten teams in Ontario, Quebec, the Great Lakes region, and the Northeastern United States.  At the same time, the NHL emerged as the only major league and the sole competitor for the Stanley Cup; in 1947, the NHL completed a deal with the Stanley Cup trustees to gain full control of the Cup.  The NHL's footprint spread across Canada as Foster Hewitt's radio broadcasts were heard coast-to-coast starting in 1933.\n\npassage title: List of Montreal Canadiens seasons\nThe Montreal Canadiens (French: \"Les Canadiens de Montréal\" ) are a professional ice hockey team based in Montreal, Quebec.

Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy.  MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree, that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided.

She died in 1915.\n\npassage title: Cheyenne military societies\nCheyenne military societies are one of the two central institutions of traditional Cheyenne Indian tribal governance, the other being the Council of Forty-four.  While council chiefs are responsible for overall governance of individual bands and the tribe as a whole, the headmen of military societies are in charge of maintaining discipline within the tribe, overseeing tribal hunts and ceremonies, and providing military leadership.  Historically, council chiefs selected which of the six military societies would assume these duties; after a period of time on-duty, the chiefs would select a different society to take up the duties.\n\npassage title: Council of Forty-four\nThe Council of Forty-four was one of the two central institutions of traditional Cheyenne Indian tribal governance, the other being the military societies such as the Dog Soldiers.

The Cheyenne comprise two Native American tribes, the Só'taeo'o or Só'taétaneo'o (more commonly spelled as Suhtai or Sutaio) and the Tsétsêhéstâhese (also spelled Tsitsistas).  These tribes merged in the early 19th century.

The band also performed in Japan for the first time on this tour.  They played Budokan Hall four nights in a row breaking the previous concert attendance record set by The Beatles.  On December 12, 1976 Ace Frehley suffered a severe electrical shock on stage which delayed the concert.  The delay lasted about fifteen minutes and then resumed; Ace was able to finish the show despite having lost feeling in one of his hands.  Being inspired by the event, Ace wrote the song \"Shock Me\" which appeared on Kiss' next album release Love Gun (1977).  It is the first Kiss song in which Ace sings lead vocals.  This was the first tour on which \"Beth\" was performed live; instead of being played by the entire band, it was sung solo by drummer Peter Criss to a recording of the instrumental track from the Destroyer album.\n</doc>\n<Question>: What 2-year worldwide tour had a round stage and a band that performed a song never before performed live?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"The U2 360° Tour was a worldwide concert tour by rock band U2, which featured a circular stage and a large four-legged structure nicknamed 'The Claw'.
