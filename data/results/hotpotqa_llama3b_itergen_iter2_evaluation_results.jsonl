Hatherley and first published in 1980.  It is similar to \"Monopoly\" but the board is divided into companies rather than properties.  Players compete to acquire properties and investments through stylized economic and political activity.  The playing time is set by agreement from all players, e.g. 2 hours, and the winner is determined by the monetary sum of all player cash, companies, insurance or other assets.  The game can also end when there are no more companies, advertisements in the bank or bonds in the treasury.  Another objective of the game is \"to teach players some of the fundamentals of economics, and the ways in which the economy and the government interact.\"  Different editions were published for several different countries.

There is a noted professional rivalry between them – between the 2001 US Open and the 2017 Australian Open tournaments, they met in nine Grand Slam singles finals.  They became the first two players, female or male, to play in 4 consecutive grand slam singles finals from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all 4 to complete the first of two \"Serena Slams\".  Between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year span, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus won 5 and Serena won 7).  By winning the 2001 Australian Open women's doubles title, they became the 5th pair to complete the Career Doubles Grand Slam and the only pair to complete the Career Doubles Golden Slam.  At the time, Venus and Serena were only 20 and 19 years old, respectively.  Since then they have gone on to add another two Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics.  Nearly a decade later, the duo would go on to win 4 consecutive grand slam doubles titles from 2009 Wimbledon through 2010 Roland Garros, which would catapult them to co-No.  1 doubles players on 7 June 2010.

It is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants, with more than 3,700 species in 434 genera including such well-known and economically important plants such as angelica, anise, asafoetida, caraway, carrot, celery, chervil, coriander, cumin, dill, fennel, hemlock, lovage, cow parsley, parsley, parsnip, sea holly, giant hogweed and silphium (a plant whose identity is unclear and which may be extinct).\n\npassage title: Apium\nApium (including celery and the marshworts) is a genus of about 20 species of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, with a subcosmopolitan distribution in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Australia.  They are medium to tall biennials or perennials growing up to 1 m high in the wet soil of marshes and salt marshes, and have pinnate to bipinnate leaves and small white flowers in compound umbels.  Some species are edible, notably \"Apium graveolens\", which includes the commercially important vegetables celery, celeriac and Chinese celery. \" Apium bermejoi\" from the island of Menorca is one of the rarest plants in Europe, with fewer than 100 individuals left.\n\npassage title: Elodea\nElodea is a genus of 6 species of aquatic plants often called the waterweeds described as a genus in 1803.  \"Elodea\" is native to North and South America and is also widely used as aquarium vegetation.  It lives in fresh water.\n\npassage title: Tricholoma apium\nTricholoma apium is a mushroom of the agaric genus \"Tricholoma\" that is found in Europe.  It is classified as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\n\npassage title: Amarylloidinae\nAmarylloidinae is a now obsolete informal name for an \"infrafamily\" within the Amaryllidaceae (Amaryllis) family, erected by Hamilton Traub.  This grouping was designed to fill a perceived gap between the formal rank of subfamily and tribes.  In his treatment of this family, he divided it first into four subfamiles.  Within subfamily Amarylloideae he then divided his sixteen tribes into two infrafamilies, Amarylloidinae (12 tribes) and Pancratioidinae (4 tribes), both of which were subsequently demonstrated to be polyphyletic, and hence were abandoned by Dahlgren, who used no rank between family and tribe.  On the other hand, he also used a much more restricted Amaryllidaceae corresponding to Traub's subfamily Amarylloideae.  Thus Traub's Amarylloideae most closely resembles subfamily Amaryllidoideae \"sensu\" APGIII.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Which genus has more species, Apium or Elodea?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<doc>\nApiaceae has more than 3,700 species in 434 genera, while Elodea has 6 species.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Which genus has more species, Apium or Elodea?\n<Answer>\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"Apiaceae has more than 3,700 species in 434 genera, while Elodea has 6 species.

The Suite is one of Bartók's most significant works for piano, only comparable with his 1926 Piano Sonata.  Though much of Bartók's work makes frequent use of Eastern European folk music, this suite is one of the few pieces without melodies of folk origin.  However, Romanian, Arabic, and North African rhythmic influences can still be found in some movements.  Originally intending the suite to be a five-movement work, Bartók later decided against the idea and discarded the second movement, the \"Andante\", which was published only posthumously in the October 1955 issue of \"Új Zenei Szemle\" (New Musical Review).\n</doc>\n<Question>: Are Benjamin Britten and Béla Bartók from the same country?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<doc>\nBéla Bartók was a Hungarian composer, pianist and an ethnomusicologist.

The most widely known member is the flat-leaved vanilla (\"V. planifolia\"), native to Mexico, from which commercial vanilla flavoring is derived.  It is the only orchid widely used for industrial purposes in flavoring such products as foods, beverages and cosmetics, and is recognized as the most popular aroma and flavor.  The key constituent imparting its popular characteristics is the phenolic aldehyde, vanillin.\n\npassage title: Vanilla\nVanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \"Vanilla\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\"V. planifolia\").  The word \"vanilla\", derived from \"vainilla\" , the diminutive of the Spanish word \"vaina\" (\"vaina\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \"little pod\".  Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called \"tlilxochitl\" by the Aztecs.  Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.\n\npassage title: Chamelaucium\nChamelaucium, also known as waxflower, is a genus of shrubs endemic to south western Western Australia.  They belong to the myrtle family Myrtaceae and have flowers similar to those of the tea-trees (\"Leptospermum\").  The most well-known species is the Geraldton Wax, \"Chamelaucium uncinatum\", which is cultivated widely for its large attractive flowers.\n\npassage title: Caryophyllales\nCaryophyllales ( ) is an order of flowering plants that includes the cacti, carnations, amaranths, ice plants, beets, and many carnivorous plants.  Many members are succulent, having fleshy stems or leaves.\n\npassage title: Sex determination in Silene\n\"Silene\" are a flowering plant that evolved a dioecious reproductive system.  This is made possible through heteromorphic sex chromosomes expressed as XY.  \"Silene\" recently evolved sex chromosomes 5-10 million years ago and are widely used by geneticists and biologists to study the mechanisms of sex determination since they are one of only 39 species across 14 families of angiosperm that possess sex-determining genes.  \"Silene\" are studied because of their ability to produce offspring with a plethora of reproductive systems.  The common inference drawn from such studies is that the sex of the offspring is determined by the Y chromosome.\n</doc>\n<Question>: what species of plants are Chamelaucium and Vanilla derived from?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<doc>\nVanilla, the vanilla orchids, forms a flowering plant genus of about 110 species in the orchid family (Orchidaceae).

There is a noted professional rivalry between them – between the 2001 US Open and the 2017 Australian Open tournaments, they met in nine Grand Slam singles finals.  They became the first two players, female or male, to play in 4 consecutive grand slam singles finals from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all 4 to complete the first of two \"Serena Slams\".  Between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year span, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus won 5 and Serena won 7).  By winning the 2001 Australian Open women's doubles title, they became the 5th pair to complete the Career Doubles Grand Slam and the only pair to complete the Career Doubles Golden Slam.  At the time, Venus and Serena were only 20 and 19 years old, respectively.  Since then they have gone on to add another two Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics.  Nearly a decade later, the duo would go on to win 4 consecutive grand slam doubles titles from 2009 Wimbledon through 2010 Roland Garros, which would catapult them to co-No.  1 doubles players on 7 June 2010.  Two weeks later, on 21 June 2010, Serena would hold the No. 1 singles ranking and Venus would be right behind her at No. 2 in singles.  Their most recent grand slam doubles titles came at the 2012 Wimbledon & 2016 Wimbledon events.

According to Anka, the song was recorded in 1983 and intended to be a duet between him and Jackson on Anka's \"Walk a Fine Line\" album under the title \"I Never Heard\", but these plans fell through.  Thereafter, Sa-Fire recorded the track for her album, \"I Wasn't Born Yesterday\" (1991).  The duet version of the song was featured in Anka's 2013 \"Duets\" album.  While putting together the \"This Is It\" album, Jackson's demo version of the song was found.  His brothers' vocals and additional instrumentation were then added to the recording.  Immediately after its release, Anka threatened legal action against Jackson's estate.  The estate then agreed to give Anka 50% of the song's publishing rights.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Are both American Zeitgeist and Michael Jackson's This Is It documentary films about entertainment?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<doc>\nAmerican Zeitgeist is a 2006 documentary film by Rob McGann.

The charts are commercial monitoring and marketing devices used by the UK music industry to measure its effectiveness in promoting and selling albums, nominally in the field of classical music.  All three charts are compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC).  The measurements are made by collating the returns of sales from a number of well-known music stores (high street and online stores) on a regular basis, and this enables a ranking to be established.  Most classical artist album sales in the UK are from crossover artists.  For an album to be classified as classical in the charts, it has to have 60% of the playing time dedicated to \"classical or traditional music\".  Only albums that entirely classical or traditional music qualify for inclusion in the Specialist Classical Albums Chart.\n\npassage title: The Friendly Guide to Music\nThe Friendly Guide to Music is a 'beginner's guide' to classical music, voiced by English actor and presenter Tony Robinson.

In jazz, such a group of twelve players is sometimes called a \"twelvetet\".  The corresponding German word is duodezett.  The French equivalent form, douzetuor, is virtually unknown (in sharp contrast to \"dixtuor\", the French word for decet).  Unlike some other musical ensembles such as the string quartet, there is no established or standard set of instruments in a duodecet.\n\npassage title: Classical music in Kosovo\nClassical music in Kosovo refers to the art music cultivated in Kosovo.

It can be said that there is a tradition of classical music in Kosovo, however, compared to other Balkan countries and especially European countries this tradition is younger.  Classical music in Kosovo reaches back about 70 years.  Even though in a short period of time, this music has evolved, passing through generations of composers and artists.
