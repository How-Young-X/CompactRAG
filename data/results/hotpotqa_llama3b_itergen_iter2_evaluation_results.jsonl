Hatherley and first published in 1980.  It is similar to \"Monopoly\" but the board is divided into companies rather than properties.  Players compete to acquire properties and investments through stylized economic and political activity.  The playing time is set by agreement from all players, e.g. 2 hours, and the winner is determined by the monetary sum of all player cash, companies, insurance or other assets.  The game can also end when there are no more companies, advertisements in the bank or bonds in the treasury.  Another objective of the game is \"to teach players some of the fundamentals of economics, and the ways in which the economy and the government interact.\"  Different editions were published for several different countries.

There is a noted professional rivalry between them – between the 2001 US Open and the 2017 Australian Open tournaments, they met in nine Grand Slam singles finals.  They became the first two players, female or male, to play in 4 consecutive grand slam singles finals from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all 4 to complete the first of two \"Serena Slams\".  Between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year span, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus won 5 and Serena won 7).  By winning the 2001 Australian Open women's doubles title, they became the 5th pair to complete the Career Doubles Grand Slam and the only pair to complete the Career Doubles Golden Slam.  At the time, Venus and Serena were only 20 and 19 years old, respectively.  Since then they have gone on to add another two Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics.  Nearly a decade later, the duo would go on to win 4 consecutive grand slam doubles titles from 2009 Wimbledon through 2010 Roland Garros, which would catapult them to co-No.  1 doubles players on 7 June 2010.

It is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants, with more than 3,700 species in 434 genera including such well-known and economically important plants such as angelica, anise, asafoetida, caraway, carrot, celery, chervil, coriander, cumin, dill, fennel, hemlock, lovage, cow parsley, parsley, parsnip, sea holly, giant hogweed and silphium (a plant whose identity is unclear and which may be extinct).\n\npassage title: Apium\nApium (including celery and the marshworts) is a genus of about 20 species of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, with a subcosmopolitan distribution in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Australia.  They are medium to tall biennials or perennials growing up to 1 m high in the wet soil of marshes and salt marshes, and have pinnate to bipinnate leaves and small white flowers in compound umbels.  Some species are edible, notably \"Apium graveolens\", which includes the commercially important vegetables celery, celeriac and Chinese celery. \" Apium bermejoi\" from the island of Menorca is one of the rarest plants in Europe, with fewer than 100 individuals left.\n\npassage title: Elodea\nElodea is a genus of 6 species of aquatic plants often called the waterweeds described as a genus in 1803.  \"Elodea\" is native to North and South America and is also widely used as aquarium vegetation.  It lives in fresh water.\n\npassage title: Tricholoma apium\nTricholoma apium is a mushroom of the agaric genus \"Tricholoma\" that is found in Europe.  It is classified as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\n\npassage title: Amarylloidinae\nAmarylloidinae is a now obsolete informal name for an \"infrafamily\" within the Amaryllidaceae (Amaryllis) family, erected by Hamilton Traub.  This grouping was designed to fill a perceived gap between the formal rank of subfamily and tribes.  In his treatment of this family, he divided it first into four subfamiles.  Within subfamily Amarylloideae he then divided his sixteen tribes into two infrafamilies, Amarylloidinae (12 tribes) and Pancratioidinae (4 tribes), both of which were subsequently demonstrated to be polyphyletic, and hence were abandoned by Dahlgren, who used no rank between family and tribe.  On the other hand, he also used a much more restricted Amaryllidaceae corresponding to Traub's subfamily Amarylloideae.  Thus Traub's Amarylloideae most closely resembles subfamily Amaryllidoideae \"sensu\" APGIII.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Which genus has more species, Apium or Elodea?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<doc>\nApiaceae has more than 3,700 species in 434 genera, while Elodea has 6 species.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Which genus has more species, Apium or Elodea?\n<Answer>\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"Apiaceae has more than 3,700 species in 434 genera, while Elodea has 6 species.

The Suite is one of Bartók's most significant works for piano, only comparable with his 1926 Piano Sonata.  Though much of Bartók's work makes frequent use of Eastern European folk music, this suite is one of the few pieces without melodies of folk origin.  However, Romanian, Arabic, and North African rhythmic influences can still be found in some movements.  Originally intending the suite to be a five-movement work, Bartók later decided against the idea and discarded the second movement, the \"Andante\", which was published only posthumously in the October 1955 issue of \"Új Zenei Szemle\" (New Musical Review).\n</doc>\n<Question>: Are Benjamin Britten and Béla Bartók from the same country?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<doc>\nBéla Bartók was a Hungarian composer, pianist and an ethnomusicologist.

The most widely known member is the flat-leaved vanilla (\"V. planifolia\"), native to Mexico, from which commercial vanilla flavoring is derived.  It is the only orchid widely used for industrial purposes in flavoring such products as foods, beverages and cosmetics, and is recognized as the most popular aroma and flavor.  The key constituent imparting its popular characteristics is the phenolic aldehyde, vanillin.\n\npassage title: Vanilla\nVanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \"Vanilla\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\"V. planifolia\").  The word \"vanilla\", derived from \"vainilla\" , the diminutive of the Spanish word \"vaina\" (\"vaina\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \"little pod\".  Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called \"tlilxochitl\" by the Aztecs.  Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.\n\npassage title: Chamelaucium\nChamelaucium, also known as waxflower, is a genus of shrubs endemic to south western Western Australia.  They belong to the myrtle family Myrtaceae and have flowers similar to those of the tea-trees (\"Leptospermum\").  The most well-known species is the Geraldton Wax, \"Chamelaucium uncinatum\", which is cultivated widely for its large attractive flowers.\n\npassage title: Caryophyllales\nCaryophyllales ( ) is an order of flowering plants that includes the cacti, carnations, amaranths, ice plants, beets, and many carnivorous plants.  Many members are succulent, having fleshy stems or leaves.\n\npassage title: Sex determination in Silene\n\"Silene\" are a flowering plant that evolved a dioecious reproductive system.  This is made possible through heteromorphic sex chromosomes expressed as XY.  \"Silene\" recently evolved sex chromosomes 5-10 million years ago and are widely used by geneticists and biologists to study the mechanisms of sex determination since they are one of only 39 species across 14 families of angiosperm that possess sex-determining genes.  \"Silene\" are studied because of their ability to produce offspring with a plethora of reproductive systems.  The common inference drawn from such studies is that the sex of the offspring is determined by the Y chromosome.\n</doc>\n<Question>: what species of plants are Chamelaucium and Vanilla derived from?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<doc>\nVanilla, the vanilla orchids, forms a flowering plant genus of about 110 species in the orchid family (Orchidaceae).

There is a noted professional rivalry between them – between the 2001 US Open and the 2017 Australian Open tournaments, they met in nine Grand Slam singles finals.  They became the first two players, female or male, to play in 4 consecutive grand slam singles finals from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all 4 to complete the first of two \"Serena Slams\".  Between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year span, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus won 5 and Serena won 7).  By winning the 2001 Australian Open women's doubles title, they became the 5th pair to complete the Career Doubles Grand Slam and the only pair to complete the Career Doubles Golden Slam.  At the time, Venus and Serena were only 20 and 19 years old, respectively.  Since then they have gone on to add another two Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics.  Nearly a decade later, the duo would go on to win 4 consecutive grand slam doubles titles from 2009 Wimbledon through 2010 Roland Garros, which would catapult them to co-No.  1 doubles players on 7 June 2010.  Two weeks later, on 21 June 2010, Serena would hold the No. 1 singles ranking and Venus would be right behind her at No. 2 in singles.  Their most recent grand slam doubles titles came at the 2012 Wimbledon & 2016 Wimbledon events.

According to Anka, the song was recorded in 1983 and intended to be a duet between him and Jackson on Anka's \"Walk a Fine Line\" album under the title \"I Never Heard\", but these plans fell through.  Thereafter, Sa-Fire recorded the track for her album, \"I Wasn't Born Yesterday\" (1991).  The duet version of the song was featured in Anka's 2013 \"Duets\" album.  While putting together the \"This Is It\" album, Jackson's demo version of the song was found.  His brothers' vocals and additional instrumentation were then added to the recording.  Immediately after its release, Anka threatened legal action against Jackson's estate.  The estate then agreed to give Anka 50% of the song's publishing rights.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Are both American Zeitgeist and Michael Jackson's This Is It documentary films about entertainment?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<doc>\nAmerican Zeitgeist is a 2006 documentary film by Rob McGann.

The charts are commercial monitoring and marketing devices used by the UK music industry to measure its effectiveness in promoting and selling albums, nominally in the field of classical music.  All three charts are compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC).  The measurements are made by collating the returns of sales from a number of well-known music stores (high street and online stores) on a regular basis, and this enables a ranking to be established.  Most classical artist album sales in the UK are from crossover artists.  For an album to be classified as classical in the charts, it has to have 60% of the playing time dedicated to \"classical or traditional music\".  Only albums that entirely classical or traditional music qualify for inclusion in the Specialist Classical Albums Chart.\n\npassage title: The Friendly Guide to Music\nThe Friendly Guide to Music is a 'beginner's guide' to classical music, voiced by English actor and presenter Tony Robinson.  It covers the period from early music, Medieval and Renaissance music, to the modern era, 20th-century classical music, contemporary classical music, and 21st-century classical music, and its objective is to create a guide to music that is not needlessly complex.\n\npassage title: Duodecet\nIn music, a duodecet—sometimes duodectet, or duodecimette—is a composition which requires twelve musicians for a performance, or a musical group that consists of twelve people.  In jazz, such a group of twelve players is sometimes called a \"twelvetet\".  The corresponding German word is duodezett.  The French equivalent form, douzetuor, is virtually unknown (in sharp contrast to \"dixtuor\", the French word for decet).  Unlike some other musical ensembles such as the string quartet, there is no established or standard set of instruments in a duodecet.\n\npassage title: Classical music in Kosovo\nClassical music in Kosovo refers to the art music cultivated in Kosovo.  The roots of classical music in Kosovo are found in the 1940s and include the time period from the times when Kosovo was part of Yugoslavia to this day.  It can be said that there is a tradition of classical music in Kosovo, however, compared to other Balkan countries and especially European countries this tradition is younger.  Classical music in Kosovo reaches back about 70 years.  Even though in a short period of time, this music has evolved, passing through generations of composers and artists.

She became famous as a candidate for the 1958 São Paulo city council elections with the intention of protesting against political corruption.  Electoral officials did not accept Cacareco's candidacy, but she eventually won 100,000 votes, more than any other party in that same election (which was also marked by rampant absenteeism).  Today, the term \"voto Cacareco\" (Cacareco vote) is commonly used to describe protest votes in Brazil.  Cacareco's candidacy inspired the Rhinoceros Party of Canada, nominally led by the rhinoceros Cornelius the First.\n\npassage title: Rhinoceros Party of Canada (1963–93)\nThe Rhinoceros Party (French: \"Parti Rhinocéros\") was a registered political party in Canada from the 1960s to the 1990s.

The creation of the organizational stage of the Party was adopted at what was called the \"Revolutionary Communist Conference\", which was held in Montreal, Quebec in November 2000 by activists and former members of the labour union movements and youth organizations of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, who felt that the revolutionary situation in Canada warranted the creation of a Party dedicated to a communist revolution.  The party was initially called the Revolutionary Communist Party (Organizing Committees) (RCP(OC)).  At this conference, participants adopted the Party's first Draft Programme.  Because of the location of the conference, the majority of the founding members were French-speaking Quebecers, and the Party began an extensive effort to reach out to the rest of Canada, starting with the Canadian Revolutionary Congress held in November 2006 in Toronto.  It is not recognized as a political party by Elections Canada, because the party rejects what it calls the \"bourgeois electoral system\" and doesn't seek recognition by the State.\n\npassage title: The New Canada\nThe New Canada is a Canadian political literature book written by Reform Party of Canada founder and leader Preston Manning and published by Macmillan Canada.  The book explains the personal, religious, and political life of Preston Manning and explains the roots and beliefs of the Reform Party.  At the time of its publishing in 1992, Reform had become a popular populist conservative party in Western Canada after the mainstream Progressive Conservative Party of Canada was collapsing in support and in 1991 decided to expand eastward into Ontario and the Maritimes.  One year later the PC party collapsed in the 1993 federal election, allowing the Reform Party to make political history in Canada, deplacing the PCs as the dominant conservative party in Canada.  Reform, later renamed the Canadian Alliance, merged with the PC Party in 2003, to form a united right-wing alternative to the governing Liberal Party of Canada, named the Conservative Party of Canada which has dropped many of the populist themes that the Reform Party had.\n\npassage title: Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada\nThe Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada (APP) is a Canadian political party that was founded in 2005.  The party was conceived by University of Lethbridge student Myron Wolf Child.  It held its founding meeting on August 21, 2005, in St. Albert, Alberta.  The APP was headed by interim leader Bill Montour, a former Chief of the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario.  In October 2005, the party had 122 confirmed members, just less than half the number needed to register as an official party in Canada.  In late October 2005, the APP sought to unite with the First Peoples National Party of Canada which also had fewer than the number of confirmed members needed to become a registered political party.  The First Peoples National Party of Canada became an eligible political party on December 6, 2005.  Whether or not this was accomplished through a merger with the APP is unclear.  If this is the case, the APP no longer exists, but, as one of the stipulations of a possible merger was that a name for the new party would be determined at the party's first convention, it is possible that the name Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada will come into usage again.\n</doc>\n<Question>: When did the party inspired by Cacareco begin in Canada?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<doc>\nThe Rhinoceros Party of Canada (French: \"Parti Rhinocéros\") was a registered political party in Canada from the 1960s to the 1990s.\n</doc>\n<Question>: When did the party inspired by Cacareco begin in Canada?\n<Answer>:\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"The Rhinoceros Party of Canada was inspired by Cacareco, and it began in Canada in the 1960s.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1960s\"\n}\n```", "total_input_tokens": 2887, "total_output_tokens": 240, "total_tokens": 3127, "total_time_consumed": 2.169219493865967, "iteration_stats": [{"iteration": 1, "input_tokens": 1366, "output_tokens": 124}, {"iteration": 2, "input_tokens": 1521, "output_tokens": 116}]}

It was released in May 1983 as the second single from Williams' album \"Strong Stuff\".  The song reached number 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart.  It was written by Williams, Dean Dillon, Gary Stewart and Tanya Tucker.  The song is notable for its combination of two singers associated with the outlaw movement with a country legend from the honky tonk days and golden age of the Grand Ole Opry.  Outlaw singers like Williams and Jennings saw themselves as taking country music back to its raw, honky tonk roots, and recording an up tempo song with Tubb (who would never have received radio airplay in the late 1970s and early 80's) and reaching #6 was a slap in the face to the proponents of the country pop sound.  The lyrics of the song, much like Williams' \"Family Tradition\" echo the sentiment that the outlaw singers and their current escapades were predated by the hard living honky tonkers of the 1950s such as Hank Williams, Sr. and Ernest Tubb, prior to the music being fairly taken over by the Nashville Sound in the 1960s.\n\npassage title: Waltzing Matilda\n\"Waltzing Matilda\" is Australia's best-known bush ballad, and has been described as the country's \"unofficial national anthem\".\n\npassage title: Little Eyes\nLittle Eyes or Little Lize (Lil' Lize) is a folksong that is popular in Cornwall, England, UK, although it originated in America.

Unless otherwise specified, Honorary Award recipients receive the same gold Oscar statuettes received by winners of the competitive Academy Awards.  Unlike the Special Achievement Award instituted in 1972 (and discontinued in 1995), those on whom the Academy confers its Honorary Award do not have to meet \"the Academy's eligibility year and deadline requirements.\"  Like the Special Achievement Award, the Special Award and Honorary Award have been used to reward significant achievements of the year that did not fit in existing categories, subsequently leading the Academy to establish several new categories, and to honor exceptional career achievements, contributions to the motion picture industry, and service to the Academy.  The Academy Honorary Award is often awarded in preference to those with noted achievements in motion pictures who have nevertheless never won an Academy Award.

In 2007 he was listed by \"The Times Higher Education Guide\" as the sixth most-cited author in the humanities and social sciences, behind Anthony Giddens, Pierre Bourdieu and Michel Foucault, and ahead of Jürgen Habermas.\n\npassage title: Goffman (disambiguation)\nErving Goffman (1922–1982) was a Canadian sociologist\n\npassage title: The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\nThe Presentation of Self in Everyday Life is a 1956 sociology book by Erving Goffman, in which Goffman uses the imagery of the theatre in order to portray the importance of human social interaction.  Originally published in Scotland in 1956 and in the United States in 1959, it is Goffman’s first and most famous book, for which he received the American Sociological Association’s MacIver award in 1961.\n\npassage title: Dramaturgy (sociology)\nDramaturgy is a sociological perspective commonly used in microsociological accounts of social interaction in everyday life.  The term was first adapted into sociology from the theatre by Erving Goffman, who developed most of the related terminology and ideas in his 1959 book, \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\".  Kenneth Burke, whom Goffman would later acknowledge as an influence, had earlier presented his notions of dramatism in 1945, which in turn derives from Shakespeare.  However, the fundamental difference between Burke's and Goffman's view is that Burke believed that life was in fact theatre, whereas Goffman viewed theatre as a metaphor.  If we imagine ourselves as directors observing what goes on in the theatre of everyday life, we are doing what Goffman called dramaturgical analysis, the study of social interaction in terms of theatrical performance.\n\npassage title: Total institution\nA total institution is a place of work and residence where a great number of similarly situated people, cut off from the wider community for a considerable time, together lead an enclosed, formally administered round of life.

The title is a reference to Thomas Jefferson's quotation, \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\"  The idea began in 2003 as \"The Cuba Project\", which was to include classic protest and folk songs recorded in Cuba.  In 2008 the album was finally recorded but in California.  About half of the songs planned for The Cuba Project were used on the final cut, with other songs coming from Jefferson Starship's previous repertoire and another project band member Paul Kantner had planned called \"On the Threshold of Fire.\"  The promotional tour for the album began in late June with shows at Larkspur, California followed by tours in the US and Europe before the album's release, and continued through December 2008 with a further tour in the US and a tour in Japan.

The previous HSBC building was built in 1935 and pulled down to make way for the current building.  The address remains as 1 Queen's Road Central (the north facing side of the building was served by Des Voeux Road, which was seashore, making Queen's Road was the main entrance, in contrast to modern day that usually accessed the bank from Des Voeux Road).  The building can be reached from Exit K of Central MTR Station and facing Statue Square.\n\npassage title: HSBC Building, the Bund\nThe HSBC Building (also known as the Municipal Government Building) is a six-floor neo-classical building in the Bund area of Shanghai, China.  It served as the headquarters of the Shanghai branch of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation from 1923 to 1955, and currently houses the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.  The building is situated at number 12, the Bund.  Designed by the British architecture firm Palmer & Turner Architects and Surveyors, construction of the building lasted from 5 May 1921 to 23 June 1923.\n\npassage title: Bank of Canton\nBank of Canton () was established in 1912 in Canton but registered as a British company in Hong Kong.  This made it the first Chinese-owned bank in Hong Kong.

Security Pacific National Bank (SPNB) bought a majority share in Bank of Canton in 1971.  In 1988, Security Pacific succeeded in wholly acquiriing Bank of Canton, which became Security Pacific Asia Bank.  When Bank of America acquired Security Pacific Corporation in 1993 it changed Security Pacific Asia Bank’s name to Bank of America (Asia).  China Construction Bank acquired Bank of America (Asia) in 2006.\n\npassage title: HSBC lions\nVarious headquarters and branch buildings of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the HSBC Group, into which the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has evolved, feature a pair of lion sculptures.

This term comes from the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the British parliament.\n\npassage title: Politics of Canada\nThe politics of Canada function within a framework of parliamentary democracy and a federal system of parliamentary government with strong democratic traditions.  Canada is a constitutional monarchy, in which the Monarch is head of state.  The country has a multi-party system in which many of its legislative practices derive from the unwritten conventions of and precedents set by the United Kingdom's Westminster Parliament.  However, Canada has evolved variations: party discipline in Canada is stronger than in the United Kingdom and more parliamentary votes are considered motions of confidence, which tends to diminish the role of non-Cabinet Members of Parliament, (MPs).  Such members, in the government caucus, and junior or lower-profile members of opposition caucuses, are known as backbenchers. Backbenchers can, however, exert their influence by sitting in parliamentary committees, like the Public Accounts Committee or the National-Defence Committee.\n\npassage title: Governance of England\nThere has not been a government of England since 1707 when the Kingdom of England ceased to exist as a sovereign state, as it merged with the Kingdom of Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.  Kingdom of Great Britain continued from 1707 until 1801 when it merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which itself became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) in 1922 (in reality; in name in 1927) upon independence for most of the island of Ireland.  The UK since then has gone through significant change to its system of government, with devolved parliaments, assemblies and governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  England, however, remains under the full jurisdiction, on all matters, of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the UK government as no devolved administration has been created for England within the new structure.  This situation has led to the anomaly, known as the West Lothian question, which is that Scottish Members of Parliament (MPs) are able to vote on legislation that affects only England whereas English MPs can not vote on certain Scottish matters due to devolution.  In some cases, such as top-up university tuition fees and foundation hospitals, the votes of Scottish MPs have been crucial in helping pass legislation for England that the majority of English MPs have opposed.\n\npassage title: Canada under British rule\nCanada first came under British rule with the Treaty of Paris (1763) which ceded New France, of which Canada was a part, to the British Empire.  Gradually, other territories, colonies, and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada.  The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas.  With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada.  Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.  A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation.  Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949.  Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.  This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom, and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  Canada's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act, subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom.\n\npassage title: British North America Acts\nThe British North America Acts 1867–1975 are the original names of a series of Acts at the core of the constitution of Canada.  They were enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Parliament of Canada.  In Canada, some of the Acts were amended or repealed by the Constitution Act, 1982.  The rest were renamed in Canada as the \"Constitution Acts\".  In the United Kingdom, those Acts that were passed by the British Parliament remain under their original names.  The term \"British North America\" (BNA) refers to the British colonies in North America.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Which system of parliament was modeled after the United Kingdom and is also used in Canada? \nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<doc>\nThe Westminster system is a parliamentary system of government modelled after that which developed in the United Kingdom.

Monmouth was the name of a castle and is now the name of a town in Wales; the name also recognises James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, the \"Black Duke\".  The first HMS \"Monmouth\" was named after the town but whilst the second one was being used the Monmouth Rebellion took place and this caused some concern to the crew.  Since that time, all of \"Monmouth\"s have had their names painted in black and the name and the crest are covered because of the shame of the Duke of Monmouth's execution.  Today the officers of the latest HMS \"Monmouth\" carry black handkerchiefs and the ship is known as the Black Duke.  However the town of Monmouth still gives the freedom of the town to the ship's crew and talks of the \"enduring link\" between the town and the ship.\n\npassage title: List of Colombian writers\nThis List of Colombian writers is an alphabetical list of writers born or brought up in Colombia, who already have Wikipedia pages in the English or Spanish Wikipedia.

He was a supporter of Tostig, and was exiled along with him in 1065.  Copsi soon fled to Orkney (then a part of Norway).  The next year (1066), he joined Tostig at Sandwich, in Kent, with 17 ships.  Copsi survived Tostig's defeat at Stamford Bridge, and when William the Conqueror prevailed at Hastings he travelled, in March 1067, to pay William homage at Barking (where William was staying while his tower was being constructed in London).  In return, William made Copsi earl of Northumbria and sent him back to York.  Copsi's rule lasted a mere five weeks, at which time he was murdered by Osulf, son of Eadulf III of the ancient Bernician family which had historically governed the area from Bamburgh, at Newburn-upon-Tyne.

January 3, 1740] June 14, 1801) was a general during the American Revolutionary War, who fought for the American Continental Army, and later defected to the British Army.  While a general on the American side, he obtained command of the fortifications at West Point, New York (which after 1802 would become the site of the U.S. Military Academy), overlooking the cliffs at the Hudson River (upriver from British-occupied New York City), and planned to surrender them to British forces.

The culmination of the Yorktown campaign, the siege proved to be the last major land battle of the American Revolutionary War in the North American theater, as the surrender by Cornwallis, and the capture of both him and his army, prompted the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict.

The tour was in support of the band's twelfth studio album \"What About Now\".  The tour was named after the lead single from \"What About Now\".  All five major continents were visited during the 2013 tour.  The tour saw the band travel to Wales for the first time since their 2001 One Wild Night Tour and was also the first time since their 1995 These Days Tour that the band returned to Africa for two dates in South Africa.  Furthermore, this tour was the first time in the band's 30-year history that they visited Bulgaria and Poland.  The tour ranked 1st on Pollstar's annual \"Top 100 Mid Year Worldwide Tours\".

It was the first concert tour in history to have 3-D visual effects.  The Smashing Pumpkins opened at the Dodger Stadium show only, in costume as The Beatles for the Halloween night performance.  The Dodger Stadium show was streamed live on the internet as well as a radio broadcast.  Two songs, \"Psycho Circus\" and \"Shout It Out Loud\", were screened live on Fox television as part of the \"Kiss Live: The Ultimate Halloween Party\" special.  The vast majority of songs in the setlist were played on the previous Alive/Worldwide concert dates, leading to some frustration from fans expecting the return of classic songs not played on the previous tour.  Peter Criss was quoted in Metal Edge magazine at the time as wanting to add \"Parasite\" to the setlist.  The tour was initially hyped as having circus-style acts as pre-show entertainment.  This ultimately happened only at the first concert at Dodger Stadium.  Peter Criss later said that it didn't work out because the circus performers wanted equal billing and that some had even wanted to use KISS' backstage dressing room.  \"2,000 Man\" was played to bring in the new Millennium at the 1999/2000 New Year's Eve show at Vancouver, advertised at the time as being recorded for Alive IV.  The Vancouver show was also notable as being the first time the original members had played non-original band era material live in concert – \"I Love It Loud\", \"Lick It Up\" and \"Heaven's on Fire\" were added to the setlist and subsequently played on the Farewell Tour.  \"Forever\" was listed on concert setlists at the Vancouver show but was not played.  It was thought at the time it may have been intended as a Paul Stanley solo version prior to \"Black Diamond\".  One notable show on the tour was the March 12 Bremen, Germany, show.  After the opening song, Paul Stanley announced that the local fire marshall had banned Kiss from using any pyrotechnics during the show.  They used a translator on stage to let the crowd understand exactly what Stanley was saying.  At the end of the performance, the band ignited all of the pyrotechnics at once; as a result, they were banned from performing in Bremen.  Ticket sales for this tour were notably slower than the previous Reunion Tour, with many of the smaller market shows underselling and a second North American leg for the summer of 1999 cancelled all together, the band ultimatly decided on embarking on a Farewell tour in the new millennium.\n\npassage title: Rock &amp; Roll Over Tour\nRock and Roll Over Tour is a concert tour by the American hard rock group Kiss.  It began November 24, 1976 (shortly after the release of the Rock and Roll Over album) and ended April 4, 1977.  It was on this tour where the band performed for the first time at Madison Square Garden on 2/18/77 - a venue all four members of the band had long dreamed of playing (February 18, 1977).  The band also performed in Japan for the first time on this tour.  They played Budokan Hall four nights in a row breaking the previous concert attendance record set by The Beatles.  On December 12, 1976 Ace Frehley suffered a severe electrical shock on stage which delayed the concert.  The delay lasted about fifteen minutes and then resumed; Ace was able to finish the show despite having lost feeling in one of his hands.  Being inspired by the event, Ace wrote the song \"Shock Me\" which appeared on Kiss' next album release Love Gun (1977).  It is the first Kiss song in which Ace sings lead vocals.

He is described as one of the finest bespoke tailors in the men’s suit business.  All of Logsdail's suits are crafted and perfected on-site in his New York City location.  He is credited for making Savile Row tailoring a local option in New York.  Logsdail is known for creating high-end suits, including lining jackets with Hermes silk scarves.  CNBC talk show host, economist and fashion icon Larry Kudlow has his suits made by Leonard Logsdail.  Logsdail has created suits for award-winning films, and is recognized as one of cinema's most sought-after tailors.  Logsdail has collaborated with esteemed film directors Steven Spielberg, Robert de Niro, Oliver Stone, Ridley Scott, and Martin Scorcese.  He has had a cameo acting role as a tailor in The Wolf of Wall Street, and The Good Shepherd.\n\npassage title: The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)\nThe Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American biographical black comedy crime film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Terence Winter, based on the memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort.

Leonardo DiCaprio (who was also a producer) stars as Belfort, with Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie as his wife Naomi Lapaglia and Kyle Chandler as Patrick Denham, the FBI agent who tries to bring him down.  Matthew McConaughey, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Joanna Lumley and Jean Dujardin also star.  The film marks the director's fifth collaboration with DiCaprio, after \"Gangs of New York\" (2002), \"The Aviator\" (2004), \"The Departed\" (2006) and \"Shutter Island\" (2010), as well as his second collaboration with Winter after the television series \"Boardwalk Empire\" (2010–14).\n\npassage title: Cameo appearance\nA cameo role or cameo appearance ( ; often shortened to just cameo) is a brief appearance or voice part of a known person in a work of the performing arts, typically unnamed or appearing as themselves.

Short appearances by celebrities, film directors, politicians, athletes or musicians are common.  A crew member of the movie or show playing a minor role can be referred to as a cameo as well, such as Alfred Hitchcock's frequently performed cameos.\n\npassage title: Academy Honorary Award\nThe Academy Honorary Award – instituted in 1948 for the 21st Academy Awards (previously called the Special Award, which was first presented in early 1929) – is given annually by the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) to celebrate motion picture achievements that are not covered by existing Academy Awards, although prior winners of competitive Academy Awards are not excluded from receiving the Honorary Award.  Unless otherwise specified, Honorary Award recipients receive the same gold Oscar statuettes received by winners of the competitive Academy Awards.  Unlike the Special Achievement Award instituted in 1972 (and discontinued in 1995), those on whom the Academy confers its Honorary Award do not have to meet \"the Academy's eligibility year and deadline requirements.\"  Like the Special Achievement Award, the Special Award and Honorary Award have been used to reward significant achievements of the year that did not fit in existing categories, subsequently leading the Academy to establish several new categories, and to honor exceptional career achievements, contributions to the motion picture industry, and service to the Academy.  The Academy Honorary Award is often awarded in preference to those with noted achievements in motion pictures who have nevertheless never won an Academy Award.  Thus, many of its recipients are Classic Hollywood stars, such as Lillian Gish, Barbara Stanwyck, Kirk Douglas, and Lauren Bacall.\n\npassage title: Various Positions (film)\nVarious Positions is a 2002 film by Vancouver, BC, lawyer and filmmaker Ori Kowarsky, starring Carly Pope and Tygh Runyan.  \"Various Positions\" won the 2002 Prix de Montréal at the Montreal World Film Festival.

According to the \"Batman\" DVD Special Edition, Elfman said that producer Jon Peters was not sure about him as a composer until Tim Burton made him play the main titles.  Elfman admitted he was stunned when Peters announced that the score would be released on its own album, as releasing a separate score album for a film was something that was rarely done in the 1980s.  Elfman's \"The Batman Theme\" went on to become an iconic piece.  It served as the basis for the theme music of \"\", which premiered in 1992, although this was later changed.

The album was No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" albums chart for six consecutive weeks.  It has sold over eleven million copies worldwide.  In 2016, film critic Matt Zoller Seitz praised Prince's songs and music videos for \"Batman\", more so than the film itself, stating that his songs \"suggest a goofy, perverse, sensuous, somewhat introverted Batman film that so far we've never gotten from anyone\", and arguing that Prince's music videos \"are more psychologically perceptive than any of the Batman films.\"\n\npassage title: Peter Guber\nHoward Peter Guber (born March 1, 1942) is an executive, entrepreneur, educator, and author.

The list is far from exhaustive, so please help to expand it by adding Wikipedia page-owning published writers who have written in any genre or field, including science and scholarship, but does not include those whose sole body of work lies outside conventional published literature such as: print journalists, bloggers, editors, librettists, lyricists, songwriters, playwrights, or screenwriters.  Please follow the entry format: use Spanish naming customs by listing both surnames of the person, use \"italics\" for authors who are best known under a pseudonym, indicate only the year of birth or the years of birth and death, and do not include place of birth or works associated with the writer, as that information should be found in their actual page.\n\npassage title: Musical composition\nMusical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music.  People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.\n\npassage title: L'Heure d'été (album)\nL'Heure d'été is a 2005 album recorded by French artist Marc Lavoine.

It plays during the opening sequence and was composed by Danny Elfman in 1989, after series creator Matt Groening approached him requesting a retro-style theme.  The piece, which took 3 days, 2 hours, 48 minutes, and 19 seconds to create, has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.

According to the \"Batman\" DVD Special Edition, Elfman said that producer Jon Peters was not sure about him as a composer until Tim Burton made him play the main titles.  Elfman admitted he was stunned when Peters announced that the score would be released on its own album, as releasing a separate score album for a film was something that was rarely done in the 1980s.  Elfman's \"The Batman Theme\" went on to become an iconic piece.  It served as the basis for the theme music of \"\", which premiered in 1992, although this was later changed.

It was released on June 20, 1989 by Warner Bros.  Records.  As a Warner Bros. stablemate, Prince's involvement in the soundtrack was designed to leverage the media company's contract-bound talent as well as fulfill the artist's need for a commercial (if not critical) revival.  The result was yet another multi-platinum successful cross-media enterprise by Warner Bros., in the vein of \"Purple Rain\".  The album was No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" albums chart for six consecutive weeks.  It has sold over eleven million copies worldwide.  In 2016, film critic Matt Zoller Seitz praised Prince's songs and music videos for \"Batman\", more so than the film itself, stating that his songs \"suggest a goofy, perverse, sensuous, somewhat introverted Batman film that so far we've never gotten from anyone\", and arguing that Prince's music videos \"are more psychologically perceptive than any of the Batman films.\"\n\npassage title: Batman: Return of the Joker\nBatman: Return of the Joker, known in Japan as Dynamite Batman (ダイナマイトバットマン , Dainamaito Battoman ) , is a 1991 platform video game, the follow-up to Sunsoft's on the Nintendo Entertainment System.

However, Batman mans the Batmobile from the 1989 film.  A remake of \"Return of the Joker\", titled Batman: Revenge of the Joker, was released on the Sega Genesis by Ringler Studios in 1992.

Gradually, other territories, colonies, and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada.  The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas.  With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada.  Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.  A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation.  Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949.  Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.  This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom, and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  Canada's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act, subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Where does the founder of The International Grenfell Association act as a missionary to?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "<doc>\nThe International Grenfell Association (IGA) is an organization founded by Sir Wilfred Grenfell to provide health care, education, religious services, and rehabilitation and other social activities to the fisherman and coastal communities in northern Newfoundland and the coast of Labrador.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Where does the founder of The International Grenfell Association act as a missionary to?\n<Answer>\n```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"The International Grenfell Association was founded by Sir Wilfred Grenfell to provide health care, education, religious services, and rehabilitation and other social activities to the fisherman and coastal communities in northern Newfoundland and the coast of Labrador.

The charts are commercial monitoring and marketing devices used by the UK music industry to measure its effectiveness in promoting and selling albums, nominally in the field of classical music.  All three charts are compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC).  The measurements are made by collating the returns of sales from a number of well-known music stores (high street and online stores) on a regular basis, and this enables a ranking to be established.  Most classical artist album sales in the UK are from crossover artists.  For an album to be classified as classical in the charts, it has to have 60% of the playing time dedicated to \"classical or traditional music\".  Only albums that entirely classical or traditional music qualify for inclusion in the Specialist Classical Albums Chart.\n\npassage title: British Academy Television Awards 2009\nThe 2009 British Academy Television Awards were held on 26 April at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

Former Governor of New Mexico Gary Johnson won the presidential nomination on the first ballot.  Retired California state court judge Jim Gray won the vice-presidential nomination, also on the first ballot.  The convention also chose to replace most of the Libertarian National Committee party officers and members-at-large.\n\npassage title: Gary Johnson presidential campaign, 2012\nThe 2012 presidential campaign of Gary Johnson, the 29th Governor of New Mexico, was announced on April 21, 2011.  He declared his candidacy for the 2012 Republican Party nomination for President of the United States.  On December 28, 2011, Johnson withdrew his candidacy for the Republican nomination, and declared his candidacy for the 2012 presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party.  The 2012 Libertarian National Convention was held during the first weekend of May 2012.  On May 5, 2012, after promoting his libertarian-oriented political positions to delegates, Johnson received the most votes at the convention and became the official 2012 Libertarian presidential nominee.  On November 6, 2012, Johnson received just under 1% of the popular vote in the general election, amounting to more than 1.2 million votes, more than double what the Barr/Root ticket received in 2008.  This was the most successful result for a third-party presidential candidacy since 2000, and the best in the Libertarian Party's history by vote number at the time.

The party's nominee for the 2016 presidential election was chosen directly by registered delegates at the 2016 Libertarian National Convention, which ran from May 26 to 30, 2016.

The Libertarian National Convention in May, 2012 chose Johnson as the party's candidate.  In November 2014, Johnson announced he would pursue the presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party for the 2016 general election.  Johnson has taken positions on many political issues as revealed through his public comments, his gubernatorial record, his Our America Initiative and his campaigns to win the Republican and Libertarian nominations.\n\npassage title: Libertarian National Convention\nThe Libertarian National Convention is held every two years by the Libertarian Party (United States) to choose members of the Libertarian National Committee (LNC), and to conduct other party business.
