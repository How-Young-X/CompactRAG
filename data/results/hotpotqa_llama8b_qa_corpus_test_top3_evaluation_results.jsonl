Newland was likely born in 1896, given that his career began that year. Therefore, we can calculate that Teinosuke Kinugasa was 86 years old when he died, while Don O. Newland was likely around 55-60 years old when his career ended in 1951. Since Teinosuke Kinugasa was significantly older when he died, we can conclude that he was older when they died.\",\n  \"answer\": \"Teinosuke Kinugasa\"\n}", "total_input_tokens": 1498, "total_output_tokens": 512, "total_tokens": 2010, "total_time_consumed": 10.36859917640686, "step_stats": [{"step": "decompose", "input_tokens": 532, "output_tokens": 258}, {"step": "final_reasoning", "input_tokens": 966, "output_tokens": 254}]}

Her first video to receive attention on MTV was \"Borderline\", followed by \"Lucky Star\" and \"Like a Virgin\", which popularized Madonna's image and fashion among younger generation.  Her early videos were released commercially on \"Madonna\" (1984), which became the best-selling videocassette of 1985.  With the title track from her third studio album \"True Blue\" (1986), Madonna's impact on MTV and popular music was established when a contest entitled \"Making My Video\", was held to create a music video for the song. \" La Isla Bonita\" and \"Who's That Girl\", both released in 1987, showed Madonna's fascination with Hispanic culture and religious symbolism.  In 1989, the video of \"Like a Prayer\" portrayed her dancing in front of burning crosses, receiving stigmata, kissing a black saint and having sex with him in a church altar.  It faced strong reaction from religious groups and media. \" Express Yourself\" released the same year was critically appreciated for its positive feminist themes.", "title": "Madonna videography", "score": 0.6160014867782593}, {"question": "Who is the lead singer of the Four Seasons?", "answer": "Frankie Valli is the lead singer of the Four Seasons", "passage": "The Four Seasons is an American rock and pop band that became internationally successful in the 1960s and 1970s.

The song was also included on the ballads compilation \"Something to Remember\" (1995) and the greatest hits compilation \"Celebration\" (2009).  Producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber, along with music director Phil Ramone, decided to use Madonna after listening to her previous recordings, employing John Bettis and Jon Lind to write the song.  After reading the script of the film, Bettis and Lind wrote the song about the situation in which the lead characters meet at a nightclub.

Faith No More were founded in 1981 as Sharp Young Men, and changed their name to Faith No Man before releasing the 1982 double A-side single \"Quiet in Heaven\" / \"Song of Liberty\".  Upon assuming the name Faith No More, the band's first two full-length albums, \"We Care a Lot\" and \"Introduce Yourself\", were driven mostly by new vocalist Chuck Mosley and the \"metallic guitar\" of Jim Martin, blending elements of rap and heavy metal music.  Mosley was later replaced by Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton, who added lyrics to the already-written music for 1989's \"The Real Thing\".  Their next studio album, \"Angel Dust\", moved away from the band's rap-influenced sound to experiment with different musical genres; a trend which became much more pronounced on the 1995 album \"King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime\".", "title": "List of songs recorded by Faith No More", "score": 0.7423998713493347}, {"question": "What is Quiet in Heaven/Song of Liberty?", "answer": "Quiet in Heaven/Song of Liberty is a double A-side single", "passage": "\"Quiet in Heaven\"/\"Song of Liberty\" is a double A-side single, and is the only official release, by Faith No Man (stylised as Faith•No Man•), before the majority of their members quit and formed Faith No More.

The drama is based on Rocky Graziano's life, and the film is likely a biographical drama. Considering the violent and turbulent nature of Rocky Graziano's life story, it is reasonable to assume that the drama is a dramatic and intense film.

We also learn that Rachelle Lefevre starred in 'Mirrors', but we need to find out if she made her film debut in 'Hitch'. The retrieved knowledge reveals that Rachelle Lefevre played the vampire Victoria Sutherland in the first two films of the Twilight saga, but it doesn't mention 'Hitch'. However, we can use our own knowledge to infer that the 'Mirrors' actress who made her film debut in 'Hitch' is likely to be a different actress, as Rachelle Lefevre's film debut was in a different film. Therefore, we can conclude that the 'Mirrors' actress who made her film debut in the 2005 comedy film 'Hitch' is not Rachelle Lefevre.\",\n  \"answer\": \"Unknown\"\n}\n\nNote: I couldn't find any information in the retrieved knowledge that directly links a 'Mirrors' actress to the 2005 comedy film 'Hitch', so I couldn't provide a specific answer.", "total_input_tokens": 1370, "total_output_tokens": 563, "total_tokens": 1933, "total_time_consumed": 11.288090705871582, "step_stats": [{"step": "decompose", "input_tokens": 534, "output_tokens": 193}, {"step": "final_reasoning", "input_tokens": 836, "output_tokens": 370}]}
