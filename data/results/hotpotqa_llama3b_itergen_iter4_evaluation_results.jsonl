Hatherley and first published in 1980.  It is similar to \"Monopoly\" but the board is divided into companies rather than properties.  Players compete to acquire properties and investments through stylized economic and political activity.  The playing time is set by agreement from all players, e.g. 2 hours, and the winner is determined by the monetary sum of all player cash, companies, insurance or other assets.  The game can also end when there are no more companies, advertisements in the bank or bonds in the treasury.  Another objective of the game is \"to teach players some of the fundamentals of economics, and the ways in which the economy and the government interact.\"  Different editions were published for several different countries.  The name \"Poleconomy\" is a portmanteau of \"politics\" and \"economy\".\n\npassage title: List of The Simpsons comics\nThe following is a list of comic book series based on the animated TV show The Simpsons and published by Bongo Comics in the United States.

They became the first two players, female or male, to play in 4 consecutive grand slam singles finals from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all 4 to complete the first of two \"Serena Slams\".  Between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year span, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus won 5 and Serena won 7).  By winning the 2001 Australian Open women's doubles title, they became the 5th pair to complete the Career Doubles Grand Slam and the only pair to complete the Career Doubles Golden Slam.  At the time, Venus and Serena were only 20 and 19 years old, respectively.  Since then they have gone on to add another two Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics.  Nearly a decade later, the duo would go on to win 4 consecutive grand slam doubles titles from 2009 Wimbledon through 2010 Roland Garros, which would catapult them to co-No.  1 doubles players on 7 June 2010.  Two weeks later, on 21 June 2010, Serena would hold the No. 1 singles ranking and Venus would be right behind her at No. 2 in singles.  Their most recent grand slam doubles titles came at the 2012 Wimbledon & 2016 Wimbledon events.  They remain very close, often watching each other's matches in support, even after one of them has been knocked out of a tournament.\n\npassage title: Overnight Delivery\nOvernight Delivery is a 1998 romantic comedy film directed by Jason Bloom.
