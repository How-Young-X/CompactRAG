Players compete to acquire properties and investments through stylized economic and political activity.  The playing time is set by agreement from all players, e.g. 2 hours, and the winner is determined by the monetary sum of all player cash, companies, insurance or other assets.  The game can also end when there are no more companies, advertisements in the bank or bonds in the treasury.  Another objective of the game is \"to teach players some of the fundamentals of economics, and the ways in which the economy and the government interact.\"  Different editions were published for several different countries.

He is considered one of the most important composers of the 20th century; he and Liszt are regarded as Hungary's greatest composers .  Through his collection and analytical study of folk music, he was one of the founders of comparative musicology, which later became ethnomusicology.\n\npassage title: Béla Bartók Music High School\nBéla Bartók Music High School (Bartók Béla Zeneművészeti Szakközépiskola) is situated in the Palace of Music (Zenepalota) in Bartók square Miskolc, Hungary.

Note that Bartók started three times anew with opus numbers, here indicated with \"(list 1)\", \"(list 2)\" and \"(list 3)\" respectively.

However, Romanian, Arabic, and North African rhythmic influences can still be found in some movements.  Originally intending the suite to be a five-movement work, Bartók later decided against the idea and discarded the second movement, the \"Andante\", which was published only posthumously in the October 1955 issue of \"Új Zenei Szemle\" (New Musical Review).\n\npassage title: Benjamin Britten\nEdward Benjamin Britten, Baron Britten {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} (22 November 1913 – 4 December 1976) was an English composer, conductor and pianist.

He played junior tennis in the New South Wales regional city of Wagga Wagga.  He won one Grand Slam singles title and thirteen Grand Slam doubles titles, and was ranked as high as World No. 2 by Lance Tingay of \"The Daily Telegraph\" in 1969.  He also coached multi-Grand Slam winning World No. 1s, Ivan Lendl, Patrick Rafter, Roger Federer, Lleyton Hewitt and former World No. 4, Jelena Dokic.\n\npassage title: Williams sisters\nThe Williams sisters are two professional American tennis players: Venus Williams (b. 1980), a seven-time Grand Slam title winner (singles), and Serena Williams (b. 1981), twenty-three-time Grand Slam title winner (singles), both of whom were coached from an early age by their parents Richard Williams and Oracene Price.  There is a noted professional rivalry between them – between the 2001 US Open and the 2017 Australian Open tournaments, they met in nine Grand Slam singles finals.  They became the first two players, female or male, to play in 4 consecutive grand slam singles finals from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all 4 to complete the first of two \"Serena Slams\".  Between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year span, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus won 5 and Serena won 7).  By winning the 2001 Australian Open women's doubles title, they became the 5th pair to complete the Career Doubles Grand Slam and the only pair to complete the Career Doubles Golden Slam.  At the time, Venus and Serena were only 20 and 19 years old, respectively.  Since then they have gone on to add another two Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics.  Nearly a decade later, the duo would go on to win 4 consecutive grand slam doubles titles from 2009 Wimbledon through 2010 Roland Garros, which would catapult them to co-No.  1 doubles players on 7 June 2010.  Two weeks later, on 21 June 2010, Serena would hold the No. 1 singles ranking and Venus would be right behind her at No. 2 in singles.  Their most recent grand slam doubles titles came at the 2012 Wimbledon & 2016 Wimbledon events.  They remain very close, often watching each other's matches in support, even after one of them has been knocked out of a tournament.\n\npassage title: Evonne Goolagong career statistics\nThis is a list of the main career statistics of Australian former tennis player Evonne Goolagong.

In addition she won five Grand Slam doubles titles, partnering Margaret Court, Peggy Michel and Helen Gourlay, as well as one mixed doubles title with Kim Warwick.  In total she won 82 singles titles, 46 doubles titles and 4 mixed doubles titles.  She achieved a No. 1 singles ranking for a two-week period in April–May 1976 although this was only officially recognized in 2007.

The roots of classical music in Kosovo are found in the 1940s and include the time period from the times when Kosovo was part of Yugoslavia to this day.  It can be said that there is a tradition of classical music in Kosovo, however, compared to other Balkan countries and especially European countries this tradition is younger.  Classical music in Kosovo reaches back about 70 years.  Even though in a short period of time, this music has evolved, passing through generations of composers and artists.  In his book \"Zhvillimi i stileve në veprat e kompozitorëve shqiptarë të Kosovës\", Engjëll Berisha comments:\n\npassage title: Canadian classical music\nIn Canada, classical music includes a range of musical styles rooted in the traditions of Western or European classical music that European settlers brought to the country from the 17th century and onwards.  As well, it includes musical styles brought by other ethnic communities from the 19th century and onwards, such as Indian classical music (Hindustani and Carnatic music) and Chinese classical music.  Since Canada's emergence as a nation in 1867, the country has produced its own composers, musicians and ensembles.  As well, it has developed a music infrastructure that includes training institutions, conservatories, performance halls, and a public radio broadcaster, CBC, which programs a moderate amount of Classical music.  There is a high level of public interest in classical music and education.\n\npassage title: The Friendly Guide to Music\nThe Friendly Guide to Music is a 'beginner's guide' to classical music, voiced by English actor and presenter Tony Robinson.

The charts are commercial monitoring and marketing devices used by the UK music industry to measure its effectiveness in promoting and selling albums, nominally in the field of classical music.  All three charts are compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC).  The measurements are made by collating the returns of sales from a number of well-known music stores (high street and online stores) on a regular basis, and this enables a ranking to be established.  Most classical artist album sales in the UK are from crossover artists.  For an album to be classified as classical in the charts, it has to have 60% of the playing time dedicated to \"classical or traditional music\".  Only albums that entirely classical or traditional music qualify for inclusion in the Specialist Classical Albums Chart.\n\npassage title: Incubus (band)\nIncubus is an American rock band from Calabasas, California.

Cacareco's candidacy inspired the Rhinoceros Party of Canada, nominally led by the rhinoceros Cornelius the First.\n\npassage title: Rhinoceros Party of Canada (1963–93)\nThe Rhinoceros Party (French: \"Parti Rhinocéros\") was a registered political party in Canada from the 1960s to the 1990s.  Operating within the tradition of political satire, the Rhinoceros Party's basic credo, their so-called primal promise, was \"a promise to keep none of our promises\".  They then promised outlandishly impossible schemes designed to amuse and entertain the voting public.\n\npassage title: Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada\nThe Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada, or RCP Canada, is a revolutionary communist party oriented around Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.  The creation of the organizational stage of the Party was adopted at what was called the \"Revolutionary Communist Conference\", which was held in Montreal, Quebec in November 2000 by activists and former members of the labour union movements and youth organizations of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, who felt that the revolutionary situation in Canada warranted the creation of a Party dedicated to a communist revolution.  The party was initially called the Revolutionary Communist Party (Organizing Committees) (RCP(OC)).  At this conference, participants adopted the Party's first Draft Programme.  Because of the location of the conference, the majority of the founding members were French-speaking Quebecers, and the Party began an extensive effort to reach out to the rest of Canada, starting with the Canadian Revolutionary Congress held in November 2006 in Toronto.  It is not recognized as a political party by Elections Canada, because the party rejects what it calls the \"bourgeois electoral system\" and doesn't seek recognition by the State.\n\npassage title: The New Canada\nThe New Canada is a Canadian political literature book written by Reform Party of Canada founder and leader Preston Manning and published by Macmillan Canada.  The book explains the personal, religious, and political life of Preston Manning and explains the roots and beliefs of the Reform Party.  At the time of its publishing in 1992, Reform had become a popular populist conservative party in Western Canada after the mainstream Progressive Conservative Party of Canada was collapsing in support and in 1991 decided to expand eastward into Ontario and the Maritimes.  One year later the PC party collapsed in the 1993 federal election, allowing the Reform Party to make political history in Canada, deplacing the PCs as the dominant conservative party in Canada.  Reform, later renamed the Canadian Alliance, merged with the PC Party in 2003, to form a united right-wing alternative to the governing Liberal Party of Canada, named the Conservative Party of Canada which has dropped many of the populist themes that the Reform Party had.\n\npassage title: Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada\nThe Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada (APP) is a Canadian political party that was founded in 2005.  The party was conceived by University of Lethbridge student Myron Wolf Child.  It held its founding meeting on August 21, 2005, in St. Albert, Alberta.  The APP was headed by interim leader Bill Montour, a former Chief of the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario.  In October 2005, the party had 122 confirmed members, just less than half the number needed to register as an official party in Canada.  In late October 2005, the APP sought to unite with the First Peoples National Party of Canada which also had fewer than the number of confirmed members needed to become a registered political party.  The First Peoples National Party of Canada became an eligible political party on December 6, 2005.  Whether or not this was accomplished through a merger with the APP is unclear.  If this is the case, the APP no longer exists, but, as one of the stipulations of a possible merger was that a name for the new party would be determined at the party's first convention, it is possible that the name Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada will come into usage again.\n</doc>\n<Question>: When did the party inspired by Cacareco begin in Canada?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"The text mentions the Rhinoceros Party of Canada, which was inspired by Cacareco's candidacy.

Islamic mysticism can be considered as a vast range that engulfs theoretical and practical and conventional mysticism and has been intertwined with sufism and in some cases they are assumed identical.  however Islamic mysticism is assumed as one of the Islamic sciences alongside theology and philosophy.

In April 1942, the new rank of \"SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer\" was created which was above \"Obergruppenführer\" and below \"Reichsführer-SS\".\n\npassage title: Karl Hermann Frank\nKarl Hermann Frank (24 January 1898 – 22 May 1946) was a prominent Sudeten German Nazi official in Czechoslovakia prior to and during World War II and an SS-\"Obergruppenführer\".

Within NATO, each member nation's corresponding military rank of corporal is combined under the NATO-standard rank scale code OR-4.  However, there are often differences in how each nation (or service in each nation) employs corporals.  Some militaries don't have corporals, but may instead have a Junior Sergeant.\n\npassage title: List of Generalobersts\nGeneraloberst, in English Colonel General, was, in Germany and Austria-Hungary—the German \"Reichswehr\" and \"Wehrmacht\", the Austro-Hungarian Common Army, and the East German National People's Army, as well as the respective police services—the second highest general officer rank, ranking above full general but below general field marshal.  It was equivalent to \"Generaladmiral\" in the \"Kriegsmarine\" until 1945, or to Flottenadmiral in the \"Volksmarine\" until 1990.  The rank was the highest ordinary military rank and the highest military rank awarded in peacetime; the higher rank of general field marshal was only awarded in wartime by the head of state.

It was released in May 1983 as the second single from Williams' album \"Strong Stuff\".  The song reached number 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart.  It was written by Williams, Dean Dillon, Gary Stewart and Tanya Tucker.  The song is notable for its combination of two singers associated with the outlaw movement with a country legend from the honky tonk days and golden age of the Grand Ole Opry.  Outlaw singers like Williams and Jennings saw themselves as taking country music back to its raw, honky tonk roots, and recording an up tempo song with Tubb (who would never have received radio airplay in the late 1970s and early 80's) and reaching #6 was a slap in the face to the proponents of the country pop sound.  The lyrics of the song, much like Williams' \"Family Tradition\" echo the sentiment that the outlaw singers and their current escapades were predated by the hard living honky tonkers of the 1950s such as Hank Williams, Sr. and Ernest Tubb, prior to the music being fairly taken over by the Nashville Sound in the 1960s.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Come from the Heart:was first recorded by an artist that sang what genre of music?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"The passage states that \\\"Come from the Heart\\\" was first recorded on the 1987 Don Williams album \\\"Traces\\\".

This surname is related to Danese in Italy and it can be found mostly in the Piedmont region.  It may also be a modification of Huguenot French origin, probably a variant of \"d'Aunay\", of geographical origin.  It may be also a Gaelic patronymic, since it is a common forename in Ireland.

The term was first adapted into sociology from the theatre by Erving Goffman, who developed most of the related terminology and ideas in his 1959 book, \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\".  Kenneth Burke, whom Goffman would later acknowledge as an influence, had earlier presented his notions of dramatism in 1945, which in turn derives from Shakespeare.  However, the fundamental difference between Burke's and Goffman's view is that Burke believed that life was in fact theatre, whereas Goffman viewed theatre as a metaphor.  If we imagine ourselves as directors observing what goes on in the theatre of everyday life, we are doing what Goffman called dramaturgical analysis, the study of social interaction in terms of theatrical performance.\n\npassage title: Total institution\nA total institution is a place of work and residence where a great number of similarly situated people, cut off from the wider community for a considerable time, together lead an enclosed, formally administered round of life.

Nonetheless, she attends many official ceremonies and functions of state either along with or in place of the president.  Traditionally, the First Lady does not hold outside employment while occupying the office.  She has her own staff, including the White House Social Secretary, the Chief of Staff, the Press Secretary, the Chief Floral Designer, and the Executive Chef.  The Office of the First Lady is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House, and is a branch of the Executive Office of the President.\n\npassage title: List of current United States first spouses\nIn the United States, the first spouse (first lady for women, first gentleman for men) is the term used to refer to the spouse of a chief executive - that is, of the spouse of the President of the United States (the First Lady of the United States and the First Gentleman of the United States) and the spouses of the governors of the 50 U.S. states and U.S. territories (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the United States Virgin Islands) and the spouse of the mayor of the District of Columbia.

This song, along with \"My Wife\", \"Heaven and Hell\" and \"The Quiet One\", were Entwistle's biggest songs to perform live.  \"The Quiet One\" was written to replace this song and \"My Wife\", which Entwistle had become quite tired of singing.

Faith No More were founded in 1981 as Sharp Young Men, and changed their name to Faith No Man before releasing the 1982 double A-side single \"Quiet in Heaven\" / \"Song of Liberty\".  Upon assuming the name Faith No More, the band's first two full-length albums, \"We Care a Lot\" and \"Introduce Yourself\", were driven mostly by new vocalist Chuck Mosley and the \"metallic guitar\" of Jim Martin, blending elements of rap and heavy metal music.  Mosley was later replaced by Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton, who added lyrics to the already-written music for 1989's \"The Real Thing\".

Fool for a Lifetime\".\n\npassage title: On Top of Old Smoky\n\"On Top of Old Smokey\" is a traditional folk song of the United States.

It went to #1 (on the \"RPM\" national singles chart) in Canada, where it remained for two weeks in October 1982.  Less successful in the United States, it nonetheless remains Rush's only American Top 40 hit, peaking at #21 on the \"Billboard\" singles chart for three weeks in October and November 1982.  It also topped the \"Billboard\" Top Tracks chart for two weeks (their first single to do so).  \"New World Man\" also reached #42 in the UK; a remixed version released as a double A-side with \"Countdown\" later reached #36 in the UK in early 1983.\n</doc>\n<Question>: when was Quiet in Heaven/Song of Liberty recorded?\nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"The passage states that \\\"Quiet in Heaven\\\" / \\\"Song of Liberty\\\" is a double A-side single released by Faith No Man in 1982.\",\n    \"answer\": \"1982\"\n}\n```", "total_input_tokens": 5203, "total_output_tokens": 322, "total_tokens": 5525, "total_time_consumed": 4.132289886474609, "iteration_stats": [{"iteration": 1, "input_tokens": 1375, "output_tokens": 88}, {"iteration": 2, "input_tokens": 1185, "output_tokens": 114}, {"iteration": 3, "input_tokens": 1267, "output_tokens": 60}, {"iteration": 4, "input_tokens": 1376, "output_tokens": 60}]}

This term comes from the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the British parliament.\n\npassage title: Politics of Canada\nThe politics of Canada function within a framework of parliamentary democracy and a federal system of parliamentary government with strong democratic traditions.  Canada is a constitutional monarchy, in which the Monarch is head of state.  The country has a multi-party system in which many of its legislative practices derive from the unwritten conventions of and precedents set by the United Kingdom's Westminster Parliament.  However, Canada has evolved variations: party discipline in Canada is stronger than in the United Kingdom and more parliamentary votes are considered motions of confidence, which tends to diminish the role of non-Cabinet Members of Parliament, (MPs).  Such members, in the government caucus, and junior or lower-profile members of opposition caucuses, are known as backbenchers. Backbenchers can, however, exert their influence by sitting in parliamentary committees, like the Public Accounts Committee or the National-Defence Committee.\n\npassage title: British North America Acts\nThe British North America Acts 1867–1975 are the original names of a series of Acts at the core of the constitution of Canada.  They were enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Parliament of Canada.  In Canada, some of the Acts were amended or repealed by the Constitution Act, 1982.  The rest were renamed in Canada as the \"Constitution Acts\".  In the United Kingdom, those Acts that were passed by the British Parliament remain under their original names.  The term \"British North America\" (BNA) refers to the British colonies in North America.\n\npassage title: Quebec Legislature\nThe Quebec Legislature (officially Parliament of Quebec, French: \"Parlement du Québec\" ) is the legislature of the province of Quebec, Canada, since Confederation in 1867.  Today, the legislature is made of two elements: the monarch of Canada, represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, and the unicameral assembly called the National Assembly of Quebec.  The legislature has existed since 1867 when Quebec, then called Canada East, became one of the founding colonies of Canadian Confederation.  From 1867 until 1968 the legislature was bicameral, containing a lower chamber called the Legislative Assembly of Quebec and an upper chamber called the Legislative Council of Quebec.\n\npassage title: Governance of England\nThere has not been a government of England since 1707 when the Kingdom of England ceased to exist as a sovereign state, as it merged with the Kingdom of Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.  Kingdom of Great Britain continued from 1707 until 1801 when it merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which itself became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) in 1922 (in reality; in name in 1927) upon independence for most of the island of Ireland.  The UK since then has gone through significant change to its system of government, with devolved parliaments, assemblies and governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  England, however, remains under the full jurisdiction, on all matters, of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the UK government as no devolved administration has been created for England within the new structure.  This situation has led to the anomaly, known as the West Lothian question, which is that Scottish Members of Parliament (MPs) are able to vote on legislation that affects only England whereas English MPs can not vote on certain Scottish matters due to devolution.  In some cases, such as top-up university tuition fees and foundation hospitals, the votes of Scottish MPs have been crucial in helping pass legislation for England that the majority of English MPs have opposed.\n</doc>\n<Question>: Which system of parliament was modeled after the United Kingdom and is also used in Canada? \nLet's think step by step.\n<Answer>:", "model_response": "```json\n{\n    \"thought\": \"The passage mentions that the Westminster system is a parliamentary system modeled after the United Kingdom.

One year later the PC party collapsed in the 1993 federal election, allowing the Reform Party to make political history in Canada, deplacing the PCs as the dominant conservative party in Canada.  Reform, later renamed the Canadian Alliance, merged with the PC Party in 2003, to form a united right-wing alternative to the governing Liberal Party of Canada, named the Conservative Party of Canada which has dropped many of the populist themes that the Reform Party had.\n\npassage title: The Wonder Who?\nThe Wonder Who?  was a \"nom de disque\" of The Four Seasons for four single records released from 1965 to 1967.

Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present \"Shape\", Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine.  Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy.  MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree, that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided.

Launched in support of the group's 2009 album \"No Line on the Horizon\", the tour visited stadiums from 2009 through 2011.  The concerts featured the band playing \"in the round\" on a circular stage, allowing the audience to surround them on all sides.  To accommodate the stage configuration, a large four-legged structure nicknamed \"The Claw\" was built above the stage, with the sound system and a cylindrical, expanding video screen on top of it.  At 164 ft tall, it was the largest stage ever constructed.  U2 claimed that the tour would be \"the first time a band has toured in stadiums with such a unique and original structure.\"\n\npassage title: OU812 Tour\nThe OU812 Tour was a concert tour by hard rock band Van Halen.  It was the second tour to include dates in Japan, and was the second with Sammy Hagar as vocalist (who had settled into the role more by this point).  It followed the Monsters of Rock Tour 1988, which had formed the first part of the promotion for the \"OU812\" album.\n\npassage title: Psycho Circus World Tour\nPsycho Circus World Tour was a Kiss concert tour in 1998–2000.  It was the first concert tour in history to have 3-D visual effects.  The Smashing Pumpkins opened at the Dodger Stadium show only, in costume as The Beatles for the Halloween night performance.  The Dodger Stadium show was streamed live on the internet as well as a radio broadcast.  Two songs, \"Psycho Circus\" and \"Shout It Out Loud\", were screened live on Fox television as part of the \"Kiss Live: The Ultimate Halloween Party\" special.  The vast majority of songs in the setlist were played on the previous Alive/Worldwide concert dates, leading to some frustration from fans expecting the return of classic songs not played on the previous tour.  Peter Criss was quoted in Metal Edge magazine at the time as wanting to add \"Parasite\" to the setlist.  The tour was initially hyped as having circus-style acts as pre-show entertainment.  This ultimately happened only at the first concert at Dodger Stadium.  Peter Criss later said that it didn't work out because the circus performers wanted equal billing and that some had even wanted to use KISS' backstage dressing room.  \"2,000 Man\" was played to bring in the new Millennium at the 1999/2000 New Year's Eve show at Vancouver, advertised at the time as being recorded for Alive IV.  The Vancouver show was also notable as being the first time the original members had played non-original band era material live in concert – \"I Love It Loud\", \"Lick It Up\" and \"Heaven's on Fire\" were added to the setlist and subsequently played on the Farewell Tour.  \"Forever\" was listed on concert setlists at the Vancouver show but was not played.  It was thought at the time it may have been intended as a Paul Stanley solo version prior to \"Black Diamond\".  One notable show on the tour was the March 12 Bremen, Germany, show.  After the opening song, Paul Stanley announced that the local fire marshall had banned Kiss from using any pyrotechnics during the show.  They used a translator on stage to let the crowd understand exactly what Stanley was saying.  At the end of the performance, the band ignited all of the pyrotechnics at once; as a result, they were banned from performing in Bremen.  Ticket sales for this tour were notably slower than the previous Reunion Tour, with many of the smaller market shows underselling and a second North American leg for the summer of 1999 cancelled all together, the band ultimatly decided on embarking on a Farewell tour in the new millennium.\n\npassage title: Because We Can (concert tour)\nBecause We Can was a concert tour by American rock band, Bon Jovi.  The tour was in support of the band's twelfth studio album \"What About Now\".  The tour was named after the lead single from \"What About Now\".  All five major continents were visited during the 2013 tour.  The tour saw the band travel to Wales for the first time since their 2001 One Wild Night Tour and was also the first time since their 1995 These Days Tour that the band returned to Africa for two dates in South Africa.  Furthermore, this tour was the first time in the band's 30-year history that they visited Bulgaria and Poland.  The tour ranked 1st on Pollstar's annual \"Top 100 Mid Year Worldwide Tours\".
