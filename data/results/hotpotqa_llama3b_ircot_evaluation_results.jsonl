Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Vanilla (genus)\npassage title: Vanilla (genus)\nVanilla, the vanilla orchids, forms a flowering plant genus of about 110 species in the orchid family (Orchidaceae).  The most widely known member is the flat-leaved vanilla (\"V. planifolia\"), native to Mexico, from which commercial vanilla flavoring is derived.  It is the only orchid widely used for industrial purposes in flavoring such products as foods, beverages and cosmetics, and is recognized as the most popular aroma and flavor.  The key constituent imparting its popular characteristics is the phenolic aldehyde, vanillin.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Chamelaucium\npassage title: Chamelaucium\nChamelaucium, also known as waxflower, is a genus of shrubs endemic to south western Western Australia.  They belong to the myrtle family Myrtaceae and have flowers similar to those of the tea-trees (\"Leptospermum\").

Valued as bush tucker as the roots are edible raw.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Sex determination in Silene\npassage title: Sex determination in Silene\n\"Silene\" are a flowering plant that evolved a dioecious reproductive system.  This is made possible through heteromorphic sex chromosomes expressed as XY.  \"Silene\" recently evolved sex chromosomes 5-10 million years ago and are widely used by geneticists and biologists to study the mechanisms of sex determination since they are one of only 39 species across 14 families of angiosperm that possess sex-determining genes.  \"Silene\" are studied because of their ability to produce offspring with a plethora of reproductive systems.  The common inference drawn from such studies is that the sex of the offspring is determined by the Y chromosome.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Arthropodium milleflorum\npassage title: Arthropodium milleflorum\nArthropodium milleflorum (pale vanilla lily) is a species of herbaceous perennial plants native to Australia.  It occurs in various habitats including alpine areas and grows to between 0.3 and 1.3 metres high and 0.3 metres wide.  The fleshy tubers were eaten by Aborigines.

It belongs to the subfamily Amaryllidoideae of the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae).\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Aspidistra\npassage title: Aspidistra\nAspidistra is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae, native to eastern and southeastern Asia, particularly China and Vietnam.  They grow in shade under trees and shrubs.  Their leaves arise more or less directly from ground level, where their flowers also appear.  The number of species known has increased considerably from the 1980s onwards, with around 100 accepted as of July 2013 . \" Aspidistra elatior\" is common worldwide as a foliage house plant that is very tolerant of neglect.  It and other species can also be grown in shade outside, where they are generally hardy to -5 C .\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Traubiinae\npassage title: Traubiinae\nTraubiinae is a subtribe of plants classified under the tribe Hippeastreae.  It belongs to the subfamily Amaryllidoideae of the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae).\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Amarylloidinae\npassage title: Amarylloidinae\nAmarylloidinae is a now obsolete informal name for an \"infrafamily\" within the Amaryllidaceae (Amaryllis) family, erected by Hamilton Traub.  This grouping was designed to fill a perceived gap between the formal rank of subfamily and tribes.  In his treatment of this family, he divided it first into four subfamiles.  Within subfamily Amarylloideae he then divided his sixteen tribes into two infrafamilies, Amarylloidinae (12 tribes) and Pancratioidinae (4 tribes), both of which were subsequently demonstrated to be polyphyletic, and hence were abandoned by Dahlgren, who used no rank between family and tribe.  On the other hand, he also used a much more restricted Amaryllidaceae corresponding to Traub's subfamily Amarylloideae.  Thus Traub's Amarylloideae most closely resembles subfamily Amaryllidoideae \"sensu\" APGIII.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Clinantheae\npassage title: Clinantheae\nClinantheae is a tribe (in the family Amaryllidaceae, subfamily Amaryllidoideae), where it forms part of the Andean clade, one of two American clades.  The tribe was described in 2000 by Alan Meerow \"et al.\" as a result of a molecular phylogenetic study of the American Amaryllidoideae.  This demonstrated that the Stenomesseae tribe, including the type genus \"Stenomesson\" was polyphyletic.  Part of the tribe segregated with the Eucharideae and were submerged into it, while the other part formed a unique subclade.  Since the type species of \"Stenomesson\" was not part of the second sublclade it was necessary to form a new name for the remaining species together with the other genera that remained.  This was \"Clinanthus\", the oldest name for these species, and consequently the tribe Clinantheae.\n</doc>\nPrevious reasoning: Aspidistra belongs to the subfamily Nolinoideae and Cyrtanthus belongs to the subfamily Amaryllidoideae.

In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.

People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Brian Josephson\npassage title: Brian Josephson\nBrian David Josephson, {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} (born 4 January 1940), is a Welsh theoretical physicist and professor emeritus of physics at the University of Cambridge.

It models a black hole as a thin, classically radiating surface (or membrane) at or vanishingly close to the black hole's event horizon.  This approach to the theory of black holes was created by Kip S. Thorne, R. H. Price and D. A. Macdonald.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Ergosphere\npassage title: Ergosphere\nThe ergosphere is a region located outside a rotating black hole's outer event horizon.  Its name was proposed by Remo Ruffini and John Archibald Wheeler during the Les Houches lectures in 1971 and is derived from the Greek word \"ergon\", which means \"work\".  It received this name because it is theoretically possible to extract energy and mass from this region.  The ergosphere touches the event horizon at the poles of a rotating black hole and extends to a greater radius at the equator.  With a low spin of the central mass the shape of the ergosphere can be approximated by an oblated spheroid, while with higher spins it resembles a pumpkin-shape.  The equatorial (maximum) radius of an ergosphere corresponds to the Schwarzschild radius of a non-rotating black hole; the polar (minimum) radius can be as little as half the Schwarzschild radius (the radius of a non-rotating black hole) in the case that the black hole is rotating maximally (at higher rotation rates the black hole could not have formed).\n</doc>\nPrevious reasoning: McFarland, USA is a sports drama film about a cross country team from a mainly Latino high school in McFarland, California.

The creation of the organizational stage of the Party was adopted at what was called the \"Revolutionary Communist Conference\", which was held in Montreal, Quebec in November 2000 by activists and former members of the labour union movements and youth organizations of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, who felt that the revolutionary situation in Canada warranted the creation of a Party dedicated to a communist revolution.  The party was initially called the Revolutionary Communist Party (Organizing Committees) (RCP(OC)).  At this conference, participants adopted the Party's first Draft Programme.  Because of the location of the conference, the majority of the founding members were French-speaking Quebecers, and the Party began an extensive effort to reach out to the rest of Canada, starting with the Canadian Revolutionary Congress held in November 2006 in Toronto.  It is not recognized as a political party by Elections Canada, because the party rejects what it calls the \"bourgeois electoral system\" and doesn't seek recognition by the State.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: The New Canada\npassage title: The New Canada\nThe New Canada is a Canadian political literature book written by Reform Party of Canada founder and leader Preston Manning and published by Macmillan Canada.

At the time of its publishing in 1992, Reform had become a popular populist conservative party in Western Canada after the mainstream Progressive Conservative Party of Canada was collapsing in support and in 1991 decided to expand eastward into Ontario and the Maritimes.  One year later the PC party collapsed in the 1993 federal election, allowing the Reform Party to make political history in Canada, deplacing the PCs as the dominant conservative party in Canada.  Reform, later renamed the Canadian Alliance, merged with the PC Party in 2003, to form a united right-wing alternative to the governing Liberal Party of Canada, named the Conservative Party of Canada which has dropped many of the populist themes that the Reform Party had.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: National Advancement Party of Canada\npassage title: National Advancement Party of Canada\nThe National Advancement Party of Canada (French: \"Parti de l'Essor National du Canada\" ) is a minor federal political party in Canada.

Pretzel built over 1400 pretzel rides and sold them to carnivals and parks.  The pretzel ride was invented by Marvin Rempfer.  Leon Cassidy was Marvin's partner in the Pretzel Amusement Ride Company.  Both names are on the patent.  Leon Cassidy patented the single-rail dark ride in 1928 along with Marvin Rempfer.  The company originated in Tumbling Dam Park on the banks of Sunset Lake in Bridgeton, New Jersey.  A rider said that \"\"It felt like I was turned and twisted like a Pretzel\"\", so the name Pretzel was chosen.  A large heavy pretzel design was originally affixed to the front of each car to prevent the car from flipping backwards.  In 1929, a standard Pretzel ride had five cars, 350 feet of track, and was one and a half minutes per ride.  A pretzel ride sold for $1,200.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Castle Park (amusement park)\npassage title: Castle Park (amusement park)\nCastle Park, formerly Castle Amusement Park, is a 25-acre amusement park and family amusement center located in Riverside, California.

People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.", "passage title: Canadian classical music\nIn Canada, classical music includes a range of musical styles rooted in the traditions of Western or European classical music that European settlers brought to the country from the 17th century and onwards.

Since Canada's emergence as a nation in 1867, the country has produced its own composers, musicians and ensembles.  As well, it has developed a music infrastructure that includes training institutions, conservatories, performance halls, and a public radio broadcaster, CBC, which programs a moderate amount of Classical music.

The charts are commercial monitoring and marketing devices used by the UK music industry to measure its effectiveness in promoting and selling albums, nominally in the field of classical music.  All three charts are compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC).  The measurements are made by collating the returns of sales from a number of well-known music stores (high street and online stores) on a regular basis, and this enables a ranking to be established.  Most classical artist album sales in the UK are from crossover artists.  For an album to be classified as classical in the charts, it has to have 60% of the playing time dedicated to \"classical or traditional music\".

It was written by Williams, Dean Dillon, Gary Stewart and Tanya Tucker.  The song is notable for its combination of two singers associated with the outlaw movement with a country legend from the honky tonk days and golden age of the Grand Ole Opry.  Outlaw singers like Williams and Jennings saw themselves as taking country music back to its raw, honky tonk roots, and recording an up tempo song with Tubb (who would never have received radio airplay in the late 1970s and early 80's) and reaching #6 was a slap in the face to the proponents of the country pop sound.  The lyrics of the song, much like Williams' \"Family Tradition\" echo the sentiment that the outlaw singers and their current escapades were predated by the hard living honky tonkers of the 1950s such as Hank Williams, Sr. and Ernest Tubb, prior to the music being fairly taken over by the Nashville Sound in the 1960s.", "passage title: Doretta's Dream\n\"Doretta's Dream\" is a 1987 single by Sarah Brightman.

People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Canadian classical music\npassage title: Canadian classical music\nIn Canada, classical music includes a range of musical styles rooted in the traditions of Western or European classical music that European settlers brought to the country from the 17th century and onwards.  As well, it includes musical styles brought by other ethnic communities from the 19th century and onwards, such as Indian classical music (Hindustani and Carnatic music) and Chinese classical music.  Since Canada's emergence as a nation in 1867, the country has produced its own composers, musicians and ensembles.  As well, it has developed a music infrastructure that includes training institutions, conservatories, performance halls, and a public radio broadcaster, CBC, which programs a moderate amount of Classical music.  There is a high level of public interest in classical music and education.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Little Eyes\npassage title: Little Eyes\nLittle Eyes or Little Lize (Lil' Lize) is a folksong that is popular in Cornwall, England, UK, although it originated in America.  It was written by Buford Abner of the Swannee River Boys in the late 1940s or early 1950s.  The first known recording is from the 1950s by an American harmony group called the Delta Rhythm Boys.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: UK Classical Charts\npassage title: UK Classical Charts\nThe UK Classical Charts are three record charts based on classical music in the United Kingdom: the Classical Artist Albums Chart, the Classical Compilation Albums Chart and the Specialist Classical Albums Chart.  The charts are commercial monitoring and marketing devices used by the UK music industry to measure its effectiveness in promoting and selling albums, nominally in the field of classical music.  All three charts are compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC).  The measurements are made by collating the returns of sales from a number of well-known music stores (high street and online stores) on a regular basis, and this enables a ranking to be established.  Most classical artist album sales in the UK are from crossover artists.  For an album to be classified as classical in the charts, it has to have 60% of the playing time dedicated to \"classical or traditional music\".  Only albums that entirely classical or traditional music qualify for inclusion in the Specialist Classical Albums Chart.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Don Williams discography\npassage title: Don Williams discography\nThis is a detailed discography for American country music artist Don Williams.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Leave Them Boys Alone\npassage title: Leave Them Boys Alone\n\"Leave Them Boys Alone\" is a song recorded by American country music artist Hank Williams Jr. with Waylon Jennings and Ernest Tubb.  It was released in May 1983 as the second single from Williams' album \"Strong Stuff\".  The song reached number 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart.  It was written by Williams, Dean Dillon, Gary Stewart and Tanya Tucker.  The song is notable for its combination of two singers associated with the outlaw movement with a country legend from the honky tonk days and golden age of the Grand Ole Opry.  Outlaw singers like Williams and Jennings saw themselves as taking country music back to its raw, honky tonk roots, and recording an up tempo song with Tubb (who would never have received radio airplay in the late 1970s and early 80's) and reaching #6 was a slap in the face to the proponents of the country pop sound.  The lyrics of the song, much like Williams' \"Family Tradition\" echo the sentiment that the outlaw singers and their current escapades were predated by the hard living honky tonkers of the 1950s such as Hank Williams, Sr. and Ernest Tubb, prior to the music being fairly taken over by the Nashville Sound in the 1960s.\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Doretta's Dream\npassage title: Doretta's Dream\n\"Doretta's Dream\" is a 1987 single by Sarah Brightman.

The privacy and security research community has become increasingly aware that usability problems severely impact the effectiveness of mechanisms designed to provide security and privacy in software systems.  Indeed, one of the four grand research challenges in information security and assurance identified by the Computing Research Association in 2003 is: \"Give end-users security controls they can understand and privacy they can control for the dynamic, pervasive computing environments of the future.\"  This is the challenge that CUPS strives to address.  CUPS is affiliated with Carnegie Mellon CyLab and has members from the Engineering and Public Policy Department, the School of Computer Science, the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, the Heinz College, and the Department of Social and Decision Sciences.\n</doc>\nPrevious reasoning: The Sanders-Brown Center on Aging was funded by a grant from the Eleanor and John Y.

The group was started by Ezra Cline and Curly Ray Cline and was originally named \"Cousin Ezra and the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers\".  The Clines came from a large family consisting of musically talented people.  Ray and Charlie's father, Charlie, was a talented banjo player and the women in the family, Geraldine and Bobbi, were great singers.  For reasons unknown, Bobbi and Geraldine never joined the band on the road but often joined in at home, especially when notable Country singers, such as Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, and Hank Williams, came visiting.  None of them ever had a music lesson yet excelled on every instrument they touched.  Natives of the Gilbert Creek region of southern West Virginia, Cousin Ezra, along with brothers Ireland (Lazy Ned) and Curly Ray Cline, were part of the original Lonesome Pine Fiddlers from about 1938, a group that worked on radio at WHIS Bluefield, West Virginia.  During World War II, Ned was killed in action.  When the Pine Fiddlers resumed regular daily broadcasts, Charlie, who played multiple instruments, joined them on a regular basis.  Charlie returned to the Fiddlers briefly before becoming a member of Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys.  During 1952-1955, Charlie worked off and on with Monroe, recording some 38 songs, all on Decca.  It has been said that he played every instrument at one time or another in the Monroe group except mandolin.  Charlie spent most of 1953 back with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers working at WJR radio in Detroit.  When Ezra brought the band to Pikeville, Kentucky, in November, Charlie rejoined Bill Monroe.  In 1954, Charlie did a session, playing lead guitar, with the Stanley Brothers and also another one on RCA with the Fiddlers, although he was not otherwise working with them at the time.  He also worked briefly as a sideman with the Osborne Brothers, although he did not record with them.  By 1958, Charlie (electric lead guitar) and his wife, Lee (electric bass), had rejoined Ezra and Curly Ray in the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, who were experimenting with a more modern sound and working a TV show in Huntington, West Virginia, in addition to daily radio in Pikeville.  In his later years, Charlie was with the Stanley Brothers.  Curly Ray also played with the Stanley Brothers at a different time as their fiddler.  Curly Ray was one of the best fiddlers in Bluegrass.  This most talented family of musicians were the best, surpassed by none.

This game developed from Triunfo, though it was from L'Hombre that the idea of bidding was adopted into other card games such as Skat, and Tarot, which owes Hombre a good portion of its betting system as well.

When the game arrived in Italy, it shared a similar name with the pre-existing game and deck known as \"trionfi\" (tarot).  While trionfi has a fifth suit that acts as permanent trumps, triomphe randomly selects one of the existing four suits as trumps.  Another common feature of this game is the robbing of the stock.  Triomphe became so popular that during the 16th century the earlier game of trionfi was gradually renamed tarocchi, tarot, or tarock.  This game is the origin of the English word \"trump\" and is the ancestor of many trick-taking games like Euchre (via Écarté) and Whist (via Ruff and Honours).\n\nWikipedia Title: passage title: Probability axioms\npassage title: Probability axioms\nIn Kolmogorov's probability theory, the probability \"P\" of some event \"E\", denoted formula_1, is usually defined such that \"P\" satisfies the Kolmogorov axioms, named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov, which are described below.\n</doc>\nPrevious reasoning: Crash is similar to Three-card brag in the sense that there is no betting.
